This Draft Article had two versions, one which laid out the procedure for election of the Governor, and the other which laid out the procedure for appointment.cThe debates focused on whether the Governor should be chosen through election or by appointment.Some members who were in favour of election pointed out that the Assembly had taken a resolution two years ago stating that the Governor would be chosen through election. One member argued that an appointed Governor could be from any state, and therefore would be an inefficient administrator since he would not have any knowledge of the people or language.Many members favoured the system of appointment, but disapproved of the process laid out in the Draft Article. One member argued that provincial autonomy and successful state cabinet governments could only be ensured by the ‘existence of a fairly impartial constitutional head’. He also opposed the system of appointment from a panel of candidates in the Draft Article as not ‘conducive to amicable relations’ since it would encourage factionalism within the party. A member of the Drafting Committee also agreed with this proposition, stating that appointment was more suitable given that the function of the Governor was ‘to be a constitutional head, a sagacious counselor and adviser to the Ministry one who can throw oil over troubled waters’. The Prime Minister agreed with these arguments, stating that appointment would ensure that the Governor was detached from state politics and able to operate fairly and impartially. Another member argued that the power to appoint should be vested in the President.One member proposed to wholly replace the Draft Article as follows:‘The Governor of a State shall be appointed by the President by warrantunder his hand and seal.’He argued that while he was in favour of appointment, the language of the Draft Article gave too much leeway to the Legislature and restricted the choice of the President. The amendment, he contended, simplified the procedure, and gave the President unfettered right to appoint a Governor. This received the popular support of the Assembly, including members of the Drafting Committee.The Assembly voted in favour of choosing the Governor by appointment, and accepted the only amendment proposed. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 31st May 1949..\n",

Article 158 Conditions of Governor's office.(1) The Governor shall not be a member of either House of Parliament or of a House of the Legislature of any State specified in the First Schedule, and if a member of either House of Parliament or of a House of the Legislature of any such State be appointed Governor, he shall be deemed to have vacated his seat in that House on the date on which he enters upon his office as Governor.(2) The Governor shall not hold any other office of profit.(3) The Governor shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of his official residences and shall be also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Parliament by law and, until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are

Constitution, 19481) The Governor shall not be a member either of Parliament or of the Legislature of any State for the time being specified in the First Schedule, and if a member of Parliament or of the Legislature of any such State be elected ( appointed) Governor, he shall be deemed to have vacated his seat in Parliament or such Legislature, as the case may be, on the date on which he enters upon his office as Governor.(2) The Governor shall not hold any other office or position of emolument.(3) The Governor shall have an official residence, and there shall be paid to the Governor such emoluments and allowances as may be determined by the Legislature of the State by law and, until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments and allowances as are specified in the Second Schedule.(4) The emoluments and allowances of the Governor shall not be diminished during his term of office.Draft Article 135 (Article 158) was debated on 31st May 1949 and 14th October 1949. It laid out the conditions of service for a Governor.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved that clause (1) be amended to prevent a member of ‘either House of Parliament or of a House’ of any State Legislature from being appointed as a Governor.The Chairman also proposed the amendment of clause (2) to read ‘The Governor shall not hold any other office of profit’.Another member of the House proposed that the requirement for the Governor to have an official residence be deleted. He argued that it was unnecessary to mention such a minor detail in the Constitution, and that other Constitutions did not include similar provisions. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that this was analogous to Draft Article 48 (Article 59) which set out the official residence of the President.There was very little debate on these proposed amendments. All amendments proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee were accepted by the Assembly, while the amendment relating to official residence was negatived. The amended Draft Article was initially adopted on 31st May 1949.Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee proposed to amend clause (3) to explicitly entitle a Governor to rent-free use of his official residence. He contended that this was necessary in light of a similar amendment to Draft Article 48 relating to the President’s official residence.The same member also proposed that the Draft Article be amended to permit Parliament to determine the emoluments and allowances payable to a Governor, rather than the concerned State Legislature. He argued that this was necessary since a Governor would be appointed by the President, and therefore it was improper for a State Legislature to deliberate on the matter.Both amendments were accepted without much opposition on 14th October 1949.\n",

office:Provided that –(a) A Governor may, by resignation under his hand addressed to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the State or where there are two Houses of the Legislature of the State, to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the Chairman of the Legislative Council of the State, resign his office;(b) A Governor may, for violation of the Constitution, be removed from office by impeachment in the manner provided in article 137 of this Constitution;(c) A Governor shall, notwithstanding the expiration of his term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office.\\nDraft Article 132 (Article 156) was debated on 31st May 1949. It set out the term of office for a Governor.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article with the following:'Term of office of Governor.- 132 (1) The Governor shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.(2) The Governor may, by writing under his hand addressed to the President; resign his office.(3) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this article, a Governor shall hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office:Provided that a Governor shall, notwithstanding the expiration of his term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office.'The debates in the Assembly were based on this amendment. The purpose was to allow the Governor to serve at the pleasure of the President.A member took issue with the amendment moved by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He argued that it would make affect the Governor independence and make him ‘a creature of the President’ if he could be removed by the latter. Another member responded that since the Assembly had decided that the Governor would be appointed by the President, the proposed amendment was necessary as the President should have the right to remove his appointee.One member proposed a number of changes to the Draft Article, to the effect that the Governor could be impeached if found ‘guilty of treason, or any offence against the safety, security or integrity of the Union’or ‘by reason of physical or mental incapacity duly certified, or if found guilty of bribery or corruption, or as provided for in article 137’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that it was unnecessary to limit the grounds on which removal could occur to those explicitly stated in the Constitution.The amendment proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee was accepted by the Assembly. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 31st May 1949.\n",

B., do solemnly affirm (or swear) that I will faithfully execute the office of Governor (or discharge the functions of the Governor) of (name of the State) and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law and that I will devote myself to the service and well-being of the people of (name of the State).Draft Article 136 (Article 159) was debated on 31st May 1949. It set out the oath or affirmation to be taken by a Governor before taking office.A member of the Drafting Committee proposed an amendment to require the Governor to make his affirmation or oath in the presence of the Chief Justice of the relevant High Court, rather than members of the State Legislature. He argued that this amendment would mirror the language of Draft Article 49 (Article 60) which set out the affirmation or oath sworn by the President.A member proposed to amend the Draft Article to allow oath-takers to ‘swear in the name of God’. He pointed out that a similar amendment had been accepted to Draft Article 49.Both amendments were endorsed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee and accepted by the Assembly without debate. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 31st May 1949.\n",

The discussions that took place on these two days revolved around the first part of, whereas the second – ‘equality before law’ part - was not debated at all. In its letter to the President of the Constituent Assembly dated 3rd November 1949 presenting its revised Draft Constitution, the Drafting Committee mentioned that – ‘We have considered it more appropriate to split this article into two parts and to transfer the latter part of this article dealing with “equality before law” to a new article 14 under the heading ‘Right to Equality’. And thus, Article 14 is introduced into the Constitution of India, 1950.\n",

The second and third clauses are self-explanatory. The Constituent Assembly debated Draft Article 14 on the 2nd, 3rd and 5th December 1948. Three key amendments were moved to the Article. The first proposed to replace the phrase ‘law’ with ‘laws in force’. It was reasoned that both terms had different meanings given to them by another article of the Constitution (Draft Article) and it was best to adopt the latter. The second wanted to include a new clause that protected individuals against ‘unreasonable searches and seizures’. This type of a provision on civil liberties, it was pointed out, could be found in the American and German Constitutions. The third amendment added ‘prosecuted and’ before ‘punished’. It was argued that if a government official was dealt with for act departmentally, he should not be prosecuted by the Courts as well for the same act, and vice versa. The Assembly was in agreement over the first and third amendments and these were passed.The second amendment too received support, however, when it came to voting, the Assembly rejected the amendment.\n",
            "          358  c0e036f3a6e306e3104a34a6064849e0  Article 163 Council of Ministers to aid and advise Governor.(1) There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Debate SummaryArticle 143, Draft Constitution, 1948(1) There shall be a Council of ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Draft Article 143 (Article 163) was debated on 1st June 1949. It created a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor.A member proposed that clause (1) be amended so that the Council could aid and advise the Governor even in the exercise of his discretionary powers. He argued that this gave the Governor more authority than the President in relation to the Council’s advice. He further contended that it violated the principles of constitutional government to invest the Governor with wide discretionary powers. A member of the Drafting Committee clarified that the Governor would be bound to act on the advice of the Council except on those matters which explicitly came under his discretionary powers under Draft Article 188. He pointed out that the present Draft Article could be later revised if the Assembly decided to remove discretionary powers altogether during the debate on Draft Article 188.A member proposed to an amendment to explicitly state that the Chief Minister, as the head of the Council, would be responsible to the Governor. He argued that the Constitution was based on the principle of the executive’s responsibility to the legislature. Since the Chief Minister would be heading the Council and adjudicating on matters of great importance, it was necessary for him to be ‘directly responsible for any advice tendered to the Constitutional head of the State.’ One member agreed with this, expressing concern that the Draft Article only required the Council to render advice to the Governor, and did not bind the latter to act on it. Another member disagreed, arguing that there may be many situations in which the advice of the Council may not be appropriate.Both amendments were negatived by the Assembly. Draft Article 163 was adopted on 1st June 1949.\n",

It provided for free and compulsory education for children under the age of fourteen.\\nAn Assembly member wanted to bring the phrasing of Draft Article 36 in line with other Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). While most provisions began with a ‘State shall strive to…’ type phrasing, Draft Article 36 began with ‘Every citizen is entitled to…’ – which read more like a legally enforceable fundamental right rather than a DPSP.\\nThere was a proposal to replace ‘education’ with ‘primary education’ arguing that the State should confine the scope of its duties to only primary education.\\nOne member expressed scepticism about Draft Article 36 and referred to (along with other provisions of the DPSPs) as ‘pious hopes and pious wishes’. This type of criticism often came up when other Articles of the DPSPs were debated.\\nIt was agreed that the language of the Draft Article should be brought in line with other Directive Principles. On the question of ‘primary education’ vs ‘education’, it was clarified that ‘education’ was intentionally used as it was linked to Article 18 that barred children below 14 from being employed; The object behind Draft Article 34 was to keep children below 14 occupied in some educational institution – for primary or any other type of education.\\nThe Draft Article was adopted with amendment.\\n[In 2002, Draft Article as adopted by the Constituent Assembly was substituted by the 86th amendment with:Provision for early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years.\\n45. The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years.\". ]\n",

This article regulated the exercise of the President’s power.A member moved an amendment to regulate the selection of Cabinet ministers and restrict the number to 15 ministers. He proposed that the ministers be elected by the houses of the Parliament on the basis of proportional representation. This would prevent a majoritarian government. He invoked the system in Switzerland to illustrate how the election of cabinet ministers would not result in any oppression or revolution. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee disagreed with these proposals. He argued that the Prime Minister must not be constitutionally mandated to have 15 ministers in the Cabinet; he/she might find it practical and efficient to have fewer ministers. On the proposal to elect ministers based on proportional representation, he urged that the Instrument of Instructions for President, that the Drafting Committee would draft, would take care of minority representation in the Cabinet.There was another proposal to delete ‘with the Prime Minister at the head’. The mover wanted to keep the Prime Minister out of the Constitution. He argued that though the institution of Prime Minister was essential to carry out government business, it should not be mentioned in the Constitution. This would also prevent the power from centralising in the hands of one Minister. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued that the Prime Minister was indispensable to achieve collective responsibility of the Cabinet and to prevent undue influence of the President on the ministers. Further, in England too, the office of Prime Minister which had previously been recognised through convention, gained statutory recognition.A member introduced amendments to allow the President to use his/her discretionary power without the Cabinet's aid. He argued that the Draft Constitution provided with a similar provision for the Governor and the same should be extended to the President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that this proposal relied on the Government of India Act, 1935 which had given the Governor-General power to act according to his discretion. He reminded that under the Indian Constitution the President merely has certain prerogatives and not functions. Therefore, this proposal was unnecessary.The Assembly negatived all the amendments. The Draft Article as introduced by the Assembly was adopted on 30th December 1948.\n",

It was introduced and debated in the Assembly towards the end of the constitution-making process on 14 and 16 November 1949. The Article restricted fundamental rights during the operation of martial law by giving officers of the state certain powers.Two substantive amendments were moved to oppose the Article. The first wanted the delete the Draft Article as it wasan open invitation to officers of the state to indulge in excesses during martial law. The second wanted to remove ‘any person’ from the text arguing that there was no need to extend the immunity provided the Article to individuals who were not officers of the state. Both amendments were countered. First, it was explained that a military officer, to successfully engage with a situation of ‘insurrection or rebellion or the overthrow of the state’, required the ability to pass orders and prescribe procedures for cases where his/her orders were violated. These powers were barred by Article 20 and 21, as the military officer was not a law-making person and the procedure that he/she prescribes would not come under ‘procedures accordingly to law’. The Draft Article, therefore, was indispensable for the military or any officerof the state to discharge his/her duties effectively during martial law. Further, it was clarified that is some cases, the onus might shift on a civilian who might not be an officer of the stateto act in waysto deal with a martial law situation. In these cases, the civilian’s actions must come under the ambit of the Draft Article.At the end of the debate, the Assembly adopted Article 34 with no amendment. \n",

It defines the name and territory of India.A member of the Drafting Committee clarified the object of using the term ‘Union of States’: it was to make it explicit that India was a federation of states. Thefederation was an indestructible unit andnot a result of an agreement between states.Another member proposed to add ‘Secular, Federal, Socialist’ to ‘Union of States’. He argued that, as the Preamble of the Constitution was not yet adopted, Draft Article 1 should embody ‘aspirations’ that the Constitution seeks to achieve. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee opposed this amendment. He notedthat the social and economic policy decisions were tobe taken by elected parliamentarians. To encode the form of society would destroy ‘democracy altogether’. He further pointed out several Directive Principles of the State Policy including the right to livelihood, redistribution of material resources and equal pay for equal work weresocialistic. There was no need to include ‘socialist’ in Draft Article 1.Some members suggested alternative names to India. One wanted ‘Bharat’ or ‘Hind’ to gain more prominence and to be placed before ‘India’. Another suggested ‘Union of Indian Socialistic republics U. I. S. R.’ on the lines of the U. S. S. R.When all the proposals were put to vote, they were negatived. The Assembly adopted Draft Article 1 on 18 September 1949.\n",

This article governed the executive business of the Government of India.A member moved an amendment to replace ‘President’ with the ‘Government of India’ so that all executive business was done in the name of the Government. He argued that the ‘personal and direct form’ needed to be replaced with ‘impersonal and collective form’. Another member in response pointedout that the ‘executive power is co-extensive with the power of the Legislature’. The President is an important link between the legislature and the executive. He also reminded that in effect, the President cannot act independently but only on the advice of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. Hence this proposal was unnecessary.The Assembly did not accept any amendments; it adopted the Draft Article on 7 January 1949.\n",

It set out the oath or affirmation to be taken by a Governor before taking office.A member of the Drafting Committee proposed an amendment to require the Governor to make his affirmation or oath in the presence of the Chief Justice of the relevant High Court, rather than members of the State Legislature. He argued that this amendment would mirror the language of Draft Article 49 (Article 60) which set out the affirmation or oath sworn by the President.A member proposed to amend the Draft Article to allow oath-takers to ‘swear in the name of God’. He pointed out that a similar amendment had been accepted to Draft Article 49.Both amendments were endorsed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee and accepted by the Assembly without debate. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 31st May 1949.\n",

It simply stated that India shall have President.There was a proposal to include a description of the President as ‘Chief Executive and Head of State’ in the Article. Members who supported this proposal argued that it would raise the President’s status and signal that people’s sovereignty was vested in him/her. However, other members said thatthe proposal was inappropriate as it suggested a presidential system of government althoughthe Draft Constitution had adopted a parliamentary one.Another member wanted to know why the term ‘Rashtrapati’, which was present in prior versions of the Draft Article, was dropped and if this was an outcome of a negative attitude towards Hindi. It was clarified that the term was dropped as a Hindi version of the Draft Constitution was going to be prepared and ‘Rashtrapati’ could be used there.At the end of the debate, the Assembly adopted the Draft Article without amendment.\n",

The debates around the Preamble revolved around the name of India and inclusion of 'God' and 'Gandhi'.One member urged the Assembly torename India as the‘Union of Indian Socialistic Republics’, similar to the USSR. Members were not convinced with this suggestion as they felt that it would go against the already adopted constitutional scheme.Another member sought to include ‘In the name of God’. Many were opposed to this suggestion – it was noted that it was unfortunate to put ‘God’ onvote. One member believed that inclusion of ‘God’ would amount to ‘compulsion of faith’ and violate the fundamental right to freedom of faith.Another proposal was made to include Gandhi’s name in the Preamble. A member was discontent with the already adopted draft articles as he felt that the Indian constitution was based on the American Supreme Court cases and Government of India Act. He opposed any association of Gandhi with the ‘rotten Constitution’.The amendments moved by the members were negatived. However, this was one of the rare instances of the Assembly proceedingswherein the membersvotedon the proposal to include ‘God’ by a show of hands. The Assembly was divided with 41 voting in favour and 68 voting against it.The Assemblyadoptedthe Preamble as presented by the Drafting Committee.\n",

Itempoweredthe Parliament to make law relating to the formation of new states and alteration of existing states.\\nOne member strongly believed that the proposal to alter an existing State must originate from the concerned State Legislature and not the parliament. The State Legislature and the people residing in a State must be consulted and involved in this decision. He further argued that a ‘democratic regime’ must ‘consult’ stakeholders of a decision and not merely impose top-down orders. The Draft Article in its current form compromised federalism and placed ‘unnecessary’ and ‘excessive’ power at the Centre.\\nNot all were convinced by this proposal. Another member noted that this proposal would stifle minority demands for separate states as it would be impossible to get a State to support its own separation. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee found this proposal unnecessary in light of an amendment moved by him.

It directed the State to separate the judiciary and executive in the public services within 3 years.The Draft Article enjoyed wide support. For the most part of colonial India, the judicial and executive wings of administration were fused – Indians felt this compromised judicial independence. Assembly members recounted that the separation of the executive and judiciary was a long-standing demand of the freedom movement. This demand was made at the very first meeting of the Congress in 1885 and thereafter in a range of Congress resolutions. One member was reluctant to support the Article. He suggested that the separation principle was important in the context of a foreign government, but was not sure of its salience in an independent India. He was concerned that the Draft Article would, in practice, give the judiciary undue power leading to judicially excess. In response, another member argued that judicial independence was far more critical with the ‘advent of democracy and freedom’.The Draft Article’s three-year time limit did not go down well with the Assembly. Members felt that the Directive Principles of State policy must only mention broad principles and not go into the details of implementation like time-limits; An amendment was then moved to remove the three-year time limit. At the end of the debate, the Assembly adopted the Draft Article with the amendment\n",

B., do solemnly affirm (or swear) that I will faithfully execute the office of President (or discharge the functions of the President) of India and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law and that I will devote myself to the service and well-being of the people of India.\"The Constituent Assembly debated Draft Article 49 (Article 60, Constitution of India, 1950) on 27 December 1948. It puts downan oath or affirmation for the President to take before entering his/her office.A member wanted to explicitly mention ‘God’ in the oath. He was concerned with the lack of invocation of ‘grace and blessing of God’ in the Constitution. The Indian religious and spiritual legacy has given special prominence to God: every religion including Hinduism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism invoke God in religious texts and ceremonies. He added that the Constitution was sacred and must be offered to God. In opposition, a member argued that this amendment would ‘be excluding those people who have no faith in God at all’. He noted that this amendment would create an 'obligation on people that they should have faith in God'.Another member passed a similar amendment. However, in his proposal ‘agnostics’ were given a choice to not invoke God and just ‘solemnly affirm’. This amendment, he argued, protected a person’s freedom of faith. Mention of ‘God’ in the oath does not impinge on the ‘secularity’ of the Indian State. Further, when a person has taken an oath, they do so in their personal capacity and not as the official head of the State. He also drew on the British and Irish examples to demonstrate how the invocation of God does not lead to communalism.Generally opposing the use of ‘God’ in the oath, a member argued that it was unnecessary to invoke ‘God’ who is omnipresent. Instead, he urged that oath must be taken in the name of the people of India, as laid out in the Irish Constitution.There was a proposal to delete the Draft Article. The mover noted that the Constitution was human-made and imperfect, the name of perfect God should not be dragged into the Constitution.A member put forth a case for including promise to not promote one’s interest and family’s aggrandisement. He highlighted that the values of the Indian freedom struggle must not be ‘copy-book maxim’ but be extended to real life.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee was in support of the inclusion of ‘God’. He believed this would not alter the ‘secular’ state. It was pointed out that the oath did not carry any legal obligations; a person swearing an oath is bound by its 'purely moral'obligations. The President must have the liberty to swear in God’s name or otherwise.The proposal to include God was accepted. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 27 December 1948.\n",

It laid down the definition and scope of Money Bills.The first iteration of the Draft Article was discussed on 20th May 1949. A member moved an amendment to insert`duty, charge, rate, levy or any other form of revenue, income or receipt by’ in clause 1 (a). He was concerned that the word ‘tax’ may be too narrowly construed by lawyers. The other forms of income or public revenue would, therefore, be excluded.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that the Committee would reconsider this provision and present it at a later stage. On 8th June 1949, he moved a series of amendments. He sought to replace clauses 1 (c) and (d) with the following:‘(c) the custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency Fund of India, the payment of moneys into or the withdrawal of moneys from any such fund;(d) the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India’Through his amendment, the Chairman introduced the Assembly to the Consolidated Fund of India. He noted that the Consolidated Fund was just another term for Public Account (revenues) of the Central Government. Citing references to the Constitutions of Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, he argued that Consolidated Fund was a necessity – it would prevent ‘proceeds of taxes being frittered away by laws made by Parliament in individual purposes without regard to the general necessity of the people at all.’A member wasapprehensive aboutthe change in nomenclature. He was not convinced as to way ‘revenues of India’ needed to be changed to ‘Consolidated Fund of India’. He believed that the latter term could create confusion as it indicatedthe existence of a fund other than revenues of India. Another member, although noted that use of ‘Consolidated Fund’ would clarify the procedural aspects of the Money Bill, it ‘burden(ed)the Constitution too much with details’.The Assembly accepted the amendments moved by the Drafting Committee and adopted the Draft Article on 8th June 1949.\n",

he thinks fit for the discharge of the functions of the Governor of a State in any contingency not provided for in this Chapter.Debate SummaryArticle 138, Draft Constitution, 1948The Legislature of a State may make such provision as it thinks fit (The President may make such provision as he thinks fit) for the discharge of the functions of the Governor of the/a State in any contingency not provided for in this Chapter.Draft Article 138 (Article 160) was debated on 1st June 1949. It allowed the President or the State Legislature to make rules for the discharge of the Governor’s functions in certain situations.Since the Assembly had decided to appoint Governors during the debate on Draft Article 131 (Article 155), one member proposed that this Draft Article be amended to reflect the same.The amendment was accepted without any debate. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 1st June 1949.\n",

the discharge of the functions of the President in any contingency not provided for in this Chapter.Debate SummaryArticle 57, Draft Constitution 1948Parliament may make such provision as it thinks fit for the discharge of the functions of the President in any contingency not provided for in this Chapter.Draft Article 57 (Article 70, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on 29th December 1948. It gave President residuary powers to discharge his/her functions.There was no substantive debate around the Draft Article. A member did not want the President to have this residuarypowers. Instead, he wantedthe Parliament to regulate itsexercise. He sought to make this provision applicable to the Vice-President as well. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that the Vice-President’s role as the Chairman of the Council of States was specifically stated in the Constitution.The Constitution also provided for a Deputy Chairman in case of the Vice-President’s absence. Hence the amendment was not necessary.The Assembly adopted the Draft Article without any amendments on 29th December 1948.\n",

It laid out the procedure to obtain additional, supplementary, or excess grants which were not included in the annual financial statement.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article with the following:'Supplementary, additional or excess grants.'95. (1) The President shall-(a) if the amount authorised by any law made in accordance with the provisions of article 94 of this Constitution to be expended for a particular service for the current financial year is found to be insufficient for the purposes of that year or when a need has arisen during the current financial year for supplementary or additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual statement for that year; or(b) if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year in excess of the amount granted for that service and for that year,cause to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament another statement showing the estimated amount of that expenditure or cause to be presented to the House of the People a demand for such excess, as the case may be.(2) The provisions of the last three preceding articles shall have effect in relation to any such statement and expenditure or demand and also to any law to be made authorising the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or the grant in respect of such demand as they have effect in relation to the annual financial statement and the expenditure mentioned therein or to a demand for a grant and the law to be made for the authorization of Appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or grant.'The debates in the Assembly were based on this Amendment.The amendment permitted the appropriation of funds for supplementary, additional, and excess grants from the Consolidated Fund of India.One member was not convinced by this Amendment, as he believed that such grants could be misused by the Executive. He instead proposed that supplementary, additional, or excess funds could only be granted by approval of both the Houses of the Parliament. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee defended this amendment: such grants were necessary for the smooth functioning of the Executive, especially during emergency circumstances.Another member argued that this Amendment was inconsistent with Draft Article 94(3) (Article 114), which stated that no money could be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made by law. Therefore, the withdrawal of any money from the fund under Draft Article 95 would violate both the Constitution and the relevant Appropriation Acts. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that Draft Article 95 authorized the President to present estimates of expenditure before the Parliament where necessary, in situations other than those envisaged by Draft Article 94. He further proposed the creation of a Contingency Fund out of the Consolidated Fund of India. The Contingency Fund could be accessed by the executive in an emergency without having to violate the Appropriation Act.The Assembly accepted the Drafting Committee’s Amendment and adopted the Draft Article on 10th June 1949.\n",

It defines the name and territory of India.A member of the Drafting Committee clarified the object of using the term ‘Union of States’: it was to make it explicit that India was a federation of states. Thefederation was an indestructible unit andnot a result of an agreement between states.Another member proposed to add ‘Secular, Federal, Socialist’ to ‘Union of States’. He argued that, as the Preamble of the Constitution was not yet adopted, Draft Article 1 should embody ‘aspirations’ that the Constitution seeks to achieve. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee opposed this amendment. He notedthat the social and economic policy decisions were tobe taken by elected parliamentarians. To encode the form of society would destroy ‘democracy altogether’. He further pointed out several Directive Principles of the State Policy including the right to livelihood, redistribution of material resources and equal pay for equal work weresocialistic. There was no need to include ‘socialist’ in Draft Article 1.Some members suggested alternative names to India. One wanted ‘Bharat’ or ‘Hind’ to gain more prominence and to be placed before ‘India’.

It laid down the composition of the Council of States.A member moved an amendment to delete clause 2. He believed that members to the Parliament must only be elected, not nominated. Nominations adversely affect the ‘internal symmetry of the Legislative bodies’. Moreover, the categories of interests from where persons could be nominated were ‘not quite consistent intrinsically, logical or scientific’. Another member argued that indirect election or nomination should not find a place in the Constitution. If the intention behind clause 2 was to rope in talented and intelligent persons to the Councils, this could be achieved through regular elections as well. Alternatively, the House could set up a board of advisors with meritorious members to aid legislative business.There was another proposal to constitute a ‘Consultative Council’ with representatives from various sectors including agriculture, industry, commerce etc. This Council would not have any administrative or executive powers. It would be entrusted with the responsibility of examining legislative proposals before being taken up by the Parliament. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee found this proposal to be unnecessary. He argued that as a matter of policy, the Government anyway consulted experts before introducing any law in the Parliament.Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to decrease the nominated members from 15 to 12.The Constituent Assembly accepted certain amendments moved by the Drafting Committee and adopted the Draft Article on 4th January 1949. The Assembly accepted a few more amendments on 17th October 1949.\n",

It regulatedlaws made under Articles 2 and 3. It statedthat these laws must provide for the amendment of First Schedule (list of States and Union Territories) and Fourth Schedule (Rajya Sabha seat allocation).There was no substantive debate on this Draft Article. One member, in the interest of brevity, sought to substitute ‘article 2 and article 3’ with ‘article 2 and 3’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee opposed this. He noted that the Drafting Committee followed a common foreign precedent. Further, even the Government of India Act, 1935 used this format.The Constituent Assembly adopted the article without amendments on 18 November 1948.\n",

the Union and of the States and of any other authority or body as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, shall perform such duties and exercise such powers in relation to the accounts of the Union and of the States as were conferred on or exercisable by the Auditor-General of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution in relation to the accounts of the Dominion of India and of the Provinces respectivelyDebate SummaryArticle 124, Draft Constitution, 1948The Auditor-General shall perform such duties and exercise such powers in relation to the accounts of the Government of India and of the Government of any State as are or may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament.Explanation.-In this article the expression \"law made by Parliament\" includes any existing law for the time being in force in the territory of India.Draft Article 125 (Article 149) was debated in the Constituent Assembly on 30 May 1949. It laid down the duties and powers of the Auditor-General. The debate began with an Assembly member moving an amendment to replace ‘and of the government of any state’ with ‘the Government of any State or any other authority’. The member wanted the scope of the Auditor General’s powers and duties to go beyond just State and Union government accounts. He argued that there were plans to set up a number of public sector corporations. While these were autonomous entities, they would receive significant public money and would be using public land and other assets. Hence, parliament should have the power to direct the Auditor-General to scrutinize the accounts of such bodies.A member responded to this amendment agreeing that parliament should have such powers but felt that the text of the article as it stood would allow for this -there was no need to explicitly mention ‘other authority’ in the Draft Article. There was another strand to the debate: a member felt that the rules that regulated the Auditor General’s powers and duties – some of which were critical in ensuring the Auditor General’s independence – had not been included in the Constitution. Instead, these were left for parliament to enact as laws. The chairman of the Drafting Committee agreed to the amendment that proposed to add ‘other authority’ to the Draft Article. On the question of rules, the chairman was sympathetic to the view but told the member who raised the issue to urge his fellow parliamentarians to enact the rules as laws once the Indian parliament commenced proceedings.The Constituent Assembly accepted the Draft Article with amendment (adding ‘any other authority’)\n",

anything in this Constitution, the President may, with the consent of the Government of a State, entrust either conditionally or unconditionally to that Government or to its officers functions in relation to any matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.(2) A law made by Parliament which applies in any State may, notwithstanding that it relates to a matter with respect to which the Legislature of the State has no power to make laws, confer powers and impose duties, or authorise the conferring of powers and the imposition of duties, upon the State or officers and authorities thereof.(3) Where by virtue of this article powers and duties have been conferred or imposed upon a State or officers or authorities thereof, there shall be paid by the Government of India to the State such sum as may be agreed, or, in default of agreement, as may be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice of India, in respect of any extra costs of administration incurred by the State in connection with the exercise of those powers and duties.\n",

SummaryArticle 31, Draft Constitution, 1948The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing-(i) That the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood;(ii) That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good;(iii) That the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment;(iv) That there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women;(v) That the strength and health of workers, men and women and the tender age of children are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength;(vi) That childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment.Draft Article 31 (Article 39) was taken up for debate in the Constituent Assembly on22ndNovember 1948. It directed the State to protect and promote the economic welfare of citizens with special emphasis on the weaker sections of society.The debate was dominated by the Assembly’s socialists who felt that the Draft Article’s clauses did not do enough to encode socialism in the Constitution. They pointed out that the language of clause allowedprivate interests to obtain the ‘ownership and control of material resources’ which was antagonistic to the economic welfare of citizens. These members moved amendments that aimed to give specificity to the clauses; they specified what came under ‘material resources’, and explicitly stated that only the State acting on behalf of the people could have control over material resources.Another member was worried about clause 3 that directed the State to prevent the concentration of wealth and moved an amendment. It was argued that unless the Assembly had plans to install a communist state, the concentration of wealth and inequities would be inevitable. Therefore, the problem was not really the concentration of wealth, but the undueconcentration of wealth.At the end of the debate, it was clarified that the clauses of the Draft Article were deliberatelyworded in a general and extensive manner; the economic system that the socialists were arguing for was compatible with the Draft Article. Therefore there was no need for the relevant amendments. The Assembly had made it clear during the debates on Draft Article 1 that it did not want to prescribe an economic model for India, and instead wished to allow the people of India to choose their favoured model through Parliament.. Hence, they favoured the general approach to the clauses of Draft Article 31.All amendments were rejected, with the exception of the minor amendment to replace‘that the strength and health’ with ‘that the health and strength’.The Assembly adopted the amended Draft Article on 22nd November 1948.\n",

            "          358  c0e036f3a6e306e3104a34a6064849e0  Article 163 Council of Ministers to aid and advise Governor.(1) There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Debate SummaryArticle 143, Draft Constitution, 1948(1) There shall be a Council of ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Draft Article 143 (Article 163) was debated on 1st June 1949. It created a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor.A member proposed that clause (1) be amended so that the Council could aid and advise the Governor even in the exercise of his discretionary powers. He argued that this gave the Governor more authority than the President in relation to the Council’s advice. He further contended that it violated the principles of constitutional government to invest the Governor with wide discretionary powers. A member of the Drafting Committee clarified that the Governor would be bound to act on the advice of the Council except on those matters which explicitly came under his discretionary powers under Draft Article 188. He pointed out that the present Draft Article could be later revised if the Assembly decided to remove discretionary powers altogether during the debate on Draft Article 188.A member proposed to an amendment to explicitly state that the Chief Minister, as the head of the Council, would be responsible to the Governor. He argued that the Constitution was based on the principle of the executive’s responsibility to the legislature. Since the Chief Minister would be heading the Council and adjudicating on matters of great importance, it was necessary for him to be ‘directly responsible for any advice tendered to the Constitutional head of the State.’ One member agreed with this, expressing concern that the Draft Article only required the Council to render advice to the Governor, and did not bind the latter to act on it. Another member disagreed, arguing that there may be many situations in which the advice of the Council may not be appropriate.Both amendments were negatived by the Assembly. Draft Article 163 was adopted on 1st June 1949.\n",

This article regulated the exercise of the President’s power.A member moved an amendment to regulate the selection of Cabinet ministers and restrict the number to 15 ministers. He proposed that the ministers be elected by the houses of the Parliament on the basis of proportional representation. This would prevent a majoritarian government. He invoked the system in Switzerland to illustrate how the election of cabinet ministers would not result in any oppression or revolution. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee disagreed with these proposals. He argued that the Prime Minister must not be constitutionally mandated to have 15 ministers in the Cabinet; he/she might find it practical and efficient to have fewer ministers. On the proposal to elect ministers based on proportional representation, he urged that the Instrument of Instructions for President, that the Drafting Committee would draft, would take care of minority representation in the Cabinet.There was another proposal to delete ‘with the Prime Minister at the head’. The mover wanted to keep the Prime Minister out of the Constitution. He argued that though the institution of Prime Minister was essential to carry out government business, it should not be mentioned in the Constitution. This would also prevent the power from centralising in the hands of one Minister. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued that the Prime Minister was indispensable to achieve collective responsibility of the Cabinet and to prevent undue influence of the President on the ministers. Further, in England too, the office of Prime Minister which had previously been recognised through convention, gained statutory recognition.A member introduced amendments to allow the President to use his/her discretionary power without the Cabinet's aid. He argued that the Draft Constitution provided with a similar provision for the Governor and the same should be extended to the President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that this proposal relied on the Government of India Act, 1935 which had given the Governor-General power to act according to his discretion. He reminded that under the Indian Constitution the President merely has certain prerogatives and not functions. Therefore, this proposal was unnecessary.The Assembly negatived all the amendments. The Draft Article as introduced by the Assembly was adopted on 30th December 1948.\n",

(1) No title shall be conferred by the State.(2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State.(3) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of the President, accept any present, emolument, title or office of any kind from or under any foreign StateArticle 18 (Draft Article 12) was debated on 30 November 1948 and 1 December 1948.The Constituent Assembly wasunanimous about the underlying principlebehind the Article: the continuation of titles in post-independentIndia would accentuate the problem of hierarchies in Indian society. From the debates, it was clear that the Article placed obligations on both the State and the citizen: the former to not recognise or confer a title and the later, to not accept one.The Assembly grappled with the question of implementation: what should be the consequences if a citizen accepts a title or the state recognised and conferred one? It was clarified that parliament could in the future pass laws that prescribed appropriate penalties and measures.Also, it was decided that titles related to military and academic distinction would be an exception to the Article. The Assembly then adopted the Article with amendment.\n",

(1) No title shall be conferred by the State.(2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State.(3) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of the President, accept any present, emolument, title or office of any kind from or under any foreign StateArticle 18 (Draft Article 12) was debated on 30 November 1948 and 1 December 1948.The Constituent Assembly wasunanimous about the underlying principlebehind the Article: the continuation of titles in post-independentIndia would accentuate the problem of hierarchies in Indian society. From the debates, it was clear that the Article placed obligations on both the State and the citizen: the former to not recognise or confer a title and the later, to not accept one.The Assembly grappled with the question of implementation: what should be the consequences if a citizen accepts a title or the state recognised and conferred one? It was clarified that parliament could in the future pass laws that prescribed appropriate penalties and measures.Also, it was decided that titles related to military and academic distinction would be an exception to the Article. The Assembly then adopted the Article with amendment.\n",

It laid down the duties and powers of the Auditor-General. The debate began with an Assembly member moving an amendment to replace ‘and of the government of any state’ with ‘the Government of any State or any other authority’. The member wanted the scope of the Auditor General’s powers and duties to go beyond just State and Union government accounts. He argued that there were plans to set up a number of public sector corporations. While these were autonomous entities, they would receive significant public money and would be using public land and other assets. Hence, parliament should have the power to direct the Auditor-General to scrutinize the accounts of such bodies.A member responded to this amendment agreeing that parliament should have such powers but felt that the text of the article as it stood would allow for this -there was no need to explicitly mention ‘other authority’ in the Draft Article. There was another strand to the debate: a member felt that the rules that regulated the Auditor General’s powers and duties – some of which were critical in ensuring the Auditor General’s independence – had not been included in the Constitution. Instead, these were left for parliament to enact as laws. The chairman of the Drafting Committee agreed to the amendment that proposed to add ‘other authority’ to the Draft Article. On the question of rules, the chairman was sympathetic to the view but told the member who raised the issue to urge his fellow parliamentarians to enact the rules as laws once the Indian parliament commenced proceedings.The Constituent Assembly accepted the Draft Article with amendment (adding ‘any other authority’)\n",

laws.This article was debated on10thAugust 1949,11thAugust 1949and12thAugust 1949.The discussions revolved around a single question: Whether the future parliament can have unfettered power to make citizenship related laws?The Chairman of the Drafting Committee introduced this Draft Article. He stated that the Assembly was not tasked with making a permanent citizenship law, instead it aimed to settle key principles that would govern citizenship at the time of commencement of the Constitution. The future parliament, he continued, has the prerogative to make a comprehensive citizenship code. He further clarified that the parliament is not bound by the preceding articles. He went to the extent that the parliament can take away citizenship from the previously declared articles and also lay down new regulating principles.One member was not convinced. He did not want the parliament’s power to legislate on citizenship to be unfettered. He proposed to add a qualifier: Parliament should not be allowed to grant equal citizenship rights to nationals of a foreign country which denies equal treatment to Indians.The Assembly did not accept any amendments and adoptedDraft Article 6 as introduced by the Drafting Committee on12thAugust 1949\n",

It was argued that the inclusion of this phrase would articulate and make explicit the real intention behind this provision which was to facilitate migration from Pakistan in the wake of civil disturbance or fear of it.Another member wanted make it compulsory to provide evidence to prove right by descent and intention to permanently reside in India. He argued that Indian citizenship must be regarded as a matter of great privilege and a cheap or easy affair.The members of the Drafting Committee reminded the Assembly that this Article sought to settle basic principles of citizenship and did not aim to establish a ‘code of nationality law’. One member went on to say that compared to the Indian constitution, no other constitution even made an attempt to comprehensively deal with various aspects of nationality law.Towards the end of the debate, some members voluntarily withdrew their amendments, while other amendmentswhich were put to vote were not accepted.The Constituent AssemblyadoptedDraft Article 5A as introduced by the Drafting Committee on12thAugust 1949.\n",

The article required Indians abroad to make an application and register before the Consular or Diplomatic office to become Indian citizens. This article was debated on10thAugust 1949,11thAugust 1949and12thAugust 1949.A member believed that the article provided unfair special treatment to Indians abroad who are seeking Indian citizenship: as it allows for application and registration even after the commencement of the Constitution. However, the previous article, which grants citizenship to persons who have migrated from Pakistan, did not receive a similar prospective application.To remedy any issues or lacunae, a member proposed to insert ‘subject to any law made by the Parliament’. He argued that, while Article 11 (Draft Article 6) empowers the Parliament to make a comprehensive law on citizenship, it cannot make any provisions that are inconsistent with the citizenship articles of the Constitution. A member of the Drafting Committee did not agree with this interpretation and argued that Article 11 (Draft Article 6) makes the addition of this phrase superfluous. Some members were not convinced by this explanation. They believed that this issue was a matter of legal interpretation and has a scope of future litigation: they urged make this article more definitive.The Assembly adopted the Article without amendments on 12 August 1949. \n",

Article 21 Protection of life and personal liberty.No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.Debate SummaryArticle 15, Draft Constitution of India, 1948No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law, nor shall any person be denied equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of IndiaDraft Article 15 was debated in the Constituent Assembly on the 6th and 13th of December 1948.Most members who took part in the debate proposed amendments that wanted to replace ‘according to procedure established by law’ with ‘without due process of law’.Members argued that this term was insufficient as the legislature of the day could pass laws establishing procedures that can place civil liberties in danger; the judiciary could only check if the established procedures were followed could not review the law itself for adherence to fundamental rights. The inclusion of the ‘due process’ term into the provision, therefore, would allow the judiciary to investigate if the law itself is consistent with provisions of fundamental rights and would be in a position to protect civil liberties. Other members that pointed out the dangers of ‘due process’ termargued that allowing for judges, who are not immune to prejudices and biases, to sit in judgment of laws passed by the legislature would be undermining the authority of the legislature and hence, un-democratic.At voting,the Assembly passed the Draft article with the term ‘according to procedure established by law’ intact.\n",

The Article was debated on 13 December 1948.The Draft Article in its priorform had restricted the re-election of a President: A person could serve as the President of India only for one term.Amember moved an amendment to remove this restriction. He noted that ‘a capable and efficient man’ should be allowed to deliver his services to the country as long as he is able to.There was another proposal to ensure that a President who hadbeen impeached from office should bebarred from being re-elected. The mover of this proposal invoked foreign experiences of how a President who was impeached on charges of corruption and other ‘nefarious’ grounds was re-elected. He added: ‘considering that public memory is so short and even party memory is short’, the chances of a previously impeached President being nominated for re-election is likely. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee believed that this issue could be considered during the discussion on the qualifications of the President. The amendment was withdrawn.The Assembly voted in favour of removing the one-time restriction for re-election. It adopted the Draft Article with the amendment.\n",

This Draft Article had two versions, one which laid out the procedure for election of the Governor, and the other which laid out the procedure for appointment.cThe debates focused on whether the Governor should be chosen through election or by appointment.Some members who were in favour of election pointed out that the Assembly had taken a resolution two years ago stating that the Governor would be chosen through election. One member argued that an appointed Governor could be from any state, and therefore would be an inefficient administrator since he would not have any knowledge of the people or language.Many members favoured the system of appointment, but disapproved of the process laid out in the Draft Article. One member argued that provincial autonomy and successful state cabinet governments could only be ensured by the ‘existence of a fairly impartial constitutional head’. He also opposed the system of appointment from a panel of candidates in the Draft Article as not ‘conducive to amicable relations’ since it would encourage factionalism within the party. A member of the Drafting Committee also agreed with this proposition, stating that appointment was more suitable given that the function of the Governor was ‘to be a constitutional head, a sagacious counselor and adviser to the Ministry one who can throw oil over troubled waters’. The Prime Minister agreed with these arguments, stating that appointment would ensure that the Governor was detached from state politics and able to operate fairly and impartially. Another member argued that the power to appoint should be vested in the President.One member proposed to wholly replace the Draft Article as follows:‘The Governor of a State shall be appointed by the President by warrantunder his hand and seal.’He argued that while he was in favour of appointment, the language of the Draft Article gave too much leeway to the Legislature and restricted the choice of the President. The amendment, he contended, simplified the procedure, and gave the President unfettered right to appoint a Governor. This received the popular support of the Assembly, including members of the Drafting Committee.The Assembly voted in favour of choosing the Governor by appointment, and accepted the only amendment proposed. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 31st May 1949..\n",

It was said that the Draft Article raised the principles of justice contained in the Criminal Procedure Code to constitutional guarantees. This would protect individual liberty against executive or legislative action. Most Assembly members were not convinced, the Draft Article attracted a lot of criticism, and many amendments were moved. Some of the key points raised by the critics on the included: first, the Draft Article did not substantively align with ‘due process’, second, it took away existing safeguards that were in the Criminal Procedure Code, and third, the processes mentioned were vague – especially related to the role of the advisory board. Underlying the Assembly members’ interventions was a common concern that the Draft Article did not do enough to protect the personal liberty of individuals against the executive and legislatures. There were some members, mainly those from the Assembly’s Drafting Committee which drew up the Draft Article, who felt that most of the criticism was unfounded. However, some of the points raised were agreed to, and the corresponding amendments were accepted. In the end, the Assembly adopted the Draft Article with amendments. \n",

It defines the name and territory of India.A member of the Drafting Committee clarified the object of using the term ‘Union of States’: it was to make it explicit that India was a federation of states. Thefederation was an indestructible unit andnot a result of an agreement between states.Another member proposed to add ‘Secular, Federal, Socialist’ to ‘Union of States’. He argued that, as the Preamble of the Constitution was not yet adopted, Draft Article 1 should embody ‘aspirations’ that the Constitution seeks to achieve. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee opposed this amendment. He notedthat the social and economic policy decisions were tobe taken by elected parliamentarians. To encode the form of society would destroy ‘democracy altogether’. He further pointed out several Directive Principles of the State Policy including the right to livelihood, redistribution of material resources and equal pay for equal work weresocialistic. There was no need to include ‘socialist’ in Draft Article 1.Some members suggested alternative names to India. One wanted ‘Bharat’ or ‘Hind’ to gain more prominence and to be placed before ‘India’. Another suggested ‘Union of Indian Socialistic republics U. I. S. R.’ on the lines of the U. S. S. R.When all the proposals were put to vote, they were negatived. The Assembly adopted Draft Article 1 on 18 September 1949.\n",

or(b) to any executive action taken otherwise than under a law containing such a recital.((2) An order made as aforesaid may extend to the whole or any part of the territory of India: Provided that where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation only in a part of the territory of India, any such order shall not extend to any other part of the territory of India unless the President, being satisfied that the security of India or any part of the territory thereof is threatened by activities in or in relation to the part of the territory of India in which the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, considers such extension to be necessary.(3) Every order made under clause (1) shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be laid before each House of Parliament.\n",

monument or place or object of artistic or historic interest, declared by or [under law made by Parliament] to be of national importance, from spoliation, disfigurement, destruction, removal, disposal or export, as the case may be.Debate SummaryDraft Article 39 (Article 49 of the Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on November 24, 1948. ‘Under law made by Parliament’ was inserted by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment Act), 1956. While preservation of history was deemed significant in general, the only debate was on whether the parliament should have the power to make these declarations. This power has today been constitutionally extended.\n",

The discussions that took place on these two days revolved around the first part of, whereas the second – ‘equality before law’ part - was not debated at all. In its letter to the President of the Constituent Assembly dated 3rd November 1949 presenting its revised Draft Constitution, the Drafting Committee mentioned that – ‘We have considered it more appropriate to split this article into two parts and to transfer the latter part of this article dealing with “equality before law” to a new article 14 under the heading ‘Right to Equality’. And thus, Article 14 is introduced into the Constitution of India, 1950.\n",

This article regulated the exercise of the President’s power.A member moved an amendment to regulate the selection of Cabinet ministers and restrict the number to 15 ministers. He proposed that the ministers be elected by the houses of the Parliament on the basis of proportional representation. This would prevent a majoritarian government. He invoked the system in Switzerland to illustrate how the election of cabinet ministers would not result in any oppression or revolution. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee disagreed with these proposals. He argued that the Prime Minister must not be constitutionally mandated to have 15 ministers in the Cabinet; he/she might find it practical and efficient to have fewer ministers. On the proposal to elect ministers based on proportional representation, he urged that the Instrument of Instructions for President, that the Drafting Committee would draft, would take care of minority representation in the Cabinet.There was another proposal to delete ‘with the Prime Minister at the head’. The mover wanted to keep the Prime Minister out of the Constitution. He argued that though the institution of Prime Minister was essential to carry out government business, it should not be mentioned in the Constitution. This would also prevent the power from centralising in the hands of one Minister. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued that the Prime Minister was indispensable to achieve collective responsibility of the Cabinet and to prevent undue influence of the President on the ministers. Further, in England too, the office of Prime Minister which had previously been recognised through convention, gained statutory recognition.A member introduced amendments to allow the President to use his/her discretionary power without the Cabinet's aid. He argued that the Draft Constitution provided with a similar provision for the Governor and the same should be extended to the President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that this proposal relied on the Government of India Act, 1935 which had given the Governor-General power to act according to his discretion. He reminded that under the Indian Constitution the President merely has certain prerogatives and not functions. Therefore, this proposal was unnecessary.The Assembly negatived all the amendments. The Draft Article as introduced by the Assembly was adopted on 30th December 1948.\n",

The inclusion of the ‘due process’ term into the provision, therefore, would allow the judiciary to investigate if the law itself is consistent with provisions of fundamental rights and would be in a position to protect civil liberties. Other members that pointed out the dangers of ‘due process’ termargued that allowing for judges, who are not immune to prejudices and biases, to sit in judgment of laws passed by the legislature would be undermining the authority of the legislature and hence, un-democratic.At voting,the Assembly passed the Draft article with the term ‘according to procedure established by law’ intact.\n",
            "          358  c0e036f3a6e306e3104a34a6064849e0  Article 163 Council of Ministers to aid and advise Governor.(1) There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Debate SummaryArticle 143, Draft Constitution, 1948(1) There shall be a Council of ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Draft Article 143 (Article 163) was debated on 1st June 1949. It created a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor.A member proposed that clause (1) be amended so that the Council could aid and advise the Governor even in the exercise of his discretionary powers. He argued that this gave the Governor more authority than the President in relation to the Council’s advice. He further contended that it violated the principles of constitutional government to invest the Governor with wide discretionary powers. A member of the Drafting Committee clarified that the Governor would be bound to act on the advice of the Council except on those matters which explicitly came under his discretionary powers under Draft Article 188. He pointed out that the present Draft Article could be later revised if the Assembly decided to remove discretionary powers altogether during the debate on Draft Article 188.A member proposed to an amendment to explicitly state that the Chief Minister, as the head of the Council, would be responsible to the Governor. He argued that the Constitution was based on the principle of the executive’s responsibility to the legislature. Since the Chief Minister would be heading the Council and adjudicating on matters of great importance, it was necessary for him to be ‘directly responsible for any advice tendered to the Constitutional head of the State.’ One member agreed with this, expressing concern that the Draft Article only required the Council to render advice to the Governor, and did not bind the latter to act on it. Another member disagreed, arguing that there may be many situations in which the advice of the Council may not be appropriate.Both amendments were negatived by the Assembly. Draft Article 163 was adopted on 1st June 1949.\n",

The Assembly was unanimous about the importance of the Draft Article in combating discriminatory practices in Indian society. However, members wanted certain tweaks.Some argued that the Draft Article did not engage with discrimination based on family and descent. Others wanted a specific mention of gardens, roads and tramways as potential public spaces where people could be discriminated. In response to these points, it was clarified that while the Draft Article specifically mentions some spaces, the general nature of the language used in the Article was sufficient to cover a wide range of public spaces including those that were not specified in the Article’s text. Also, in addition to the clause in the Draft Article which allowed the state to make special provisions for women and children, there was a proposal to add a similar clause for Scheduled Castes and Tribes as well. This was not adopted – it was argued that this approach would perpetuate the segregation of Scheduled Castes and Tribes. The Article was adopted with some amendments.\n",

(1) No title shall be conferred by the State.(2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State.(3) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of the President, accept any present, emolument, title or office of any kind from or under any foreign StateArticle 18 (Draft Article 12) was debated on 30 November 1948 and 1 December 1948.The Constituent Assembly wasunanimous about the underlying principlebehind the Article: the continuation of titles in post-independentIndia would accentuate the problem of hierarchies in Indian society. From the debates, it was clear that the Article placed obligations on both the State and the citizen: the former to not recognise or confer a title and the later, to not accept one.The Assembly grappled with the question of implementation: what should be the consequences if a citizen accepts a title or the state recognised and conferred one? It was clarified that parliament could in the future pass laws that prescribed appropriate penalties and measures.Also, it was decided that titles related to military and academic distinction would be an exception to the Article. The Assembly then adopted the Article with amendment.\n",

The discussions that took place on these two days revolved around the first part of, whereas the second – ‘equality before law’ part - was not debated at all. In its letter to the President of the Constituent Assembly dated 3rd November 1949 presenting its revised Draft Constitution, the Drafting Committee mentioned that – ‘We have considered it more appropriate to split this article into two parts and to transfer the latter part of this article dealing with “equality before law” to a new article 14 under the heading ‘Right to Equality’. And thus, Article 14 is introduced into the Constitution of India, 1950.\n",

This article regulated the exercise of the President’s power.A member moved an amendment to regulate the selection of Cabinet ministers and restrict the number to 15 ministers. He proposed that the ministers be elected by the houses of the Parliament on the basis of proportional representation. This would prevent a majoritarian government. He invoked the system in Switzerland to illustrate how the election of cabinet ministers would not result in any oppression or revolution. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee disagreed with these proposals. He argued that the Prime Minister must not be constitutionally mandated to have 15 ministers in the Cabinet; he/she might find it practical and efficient to have fewer ministers. On the proposal to elect ministers based on proportional representation, he urged that the Instrument of Instructions for President, that the Drafting Committee would draft, would take care of minority representation in the Cabinet.There was another proposal to delete ‘with the Prime Minister at the head’. The mover wanted to keep the Prime Minister out of the Constitution. He argued that though the institution of Prime Minister was essential to carry out government business, it should not be mentioned in the Constitution. This would also prevent the power from centralising in the hands of one Minister. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued that the Prime Minister was indispensable to achieve collective responsibility of the Cabinet and to prevent undue influence of the President on the ministers. Further, in England too, the office of Prime Minister which had previously been recognised through convention, gained statutory recognition.A member introduced amendments to allow the President to use his/her discretionary power without the Cabinet's aid. He argued that the Draft Constitution provided with a similar provision for the Governor and the same should be extended to the President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that this proposal relied on the Government of India Act, 1935 which had given the Governor-General power to act according to his discretion. He reminded that under the Indian Constitution the President merely has certain prerogatives and not functions. Therefore, this proposal was unnecessary.The Assembly negatived all the amendments. The Draft Article as introduced by the Assembly was adopted on 30th December 1948.\n",

The inclusion of the ‘due process’ term into the provision, therefore, would allow the judiciary to investigate if the law itself is consistent with provisions of fundamental rights and would be in a position to protect civil liberties. Other members that pointed out the dangers of ‘due process’ termargued that allowing for judges, who are not immune to prejudices and biases, to sit in judgment of laws passed by the legislature would be undermining the authority of the legislature and hence, un-democratic.At voting,the Assembly passed the Draft article with the term ‘according to procedure established by law’ intact.\n",
            "          358  c0e036f3a6e306e3104a34a6064849e0  Article 163 Council of Ministers to aid and advise Governor.(1) There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Debate SummaryArticle 143, Draft Constitution, 1948(1) There shall be a Council of ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.(2) If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion.(3) The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court.Draft Article 143 (Article 163) was debated on 1st June 1949. It created a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor.A member proposed that clause (1) be amended so that the Council could aid and advise the Governor even in the exercise of his discretionary powers. He argued that this gave the Governor more authority than the President in relation to the Council’s advice. He further contended that it violated the principles of constitutional government to invest the Governor with wide discretionary powers. A member of the Drafting Committee clarified that the Governor would be bound to act on the advice of the Council except on those matters which explicitly came under his discretionary powers under Draft Article 188. He pointed out that the present Draft Article could be later revised if the Assembly decided to remove discretionary powers altogether during the debate on Draft Article 188.A member proposed to an amendment to explicitly state that the Chief Minister, as the head of the Council, would be responsible to the Governor. He argued that the Constitution was based on the principle of the executive’s responsibility to the legislature. Since the Chief Minister would be heading the Council and adjudicating on matters of great importance, it was necessary for him to be ‘directly responsible for any advice tendered to the Constitutional head of the State.’ One member agreed with this, expressing concern that the Draft Article only required the Council to render advice to the Governor, and did not bind the latter to act on it. Another member disagreed, arguing that there may be many situations in which the advice of the Council may not be appropriate.Both amendments were negatived by the Assembly. Draft Article 163 was adopted on 1st June 1949.\n",

The Assembly was unanimous about the importance of the Draft Article in combating discriminatory practices in Indian society. However, members wanted certain tweaks.Some argued that the Draft Article did not engage with discrimination based on family and descent. Others wanted a specific mention of gardens, roads and tramways as potential public spaces where people could be discriminated. In response to these points, it was clarified that while the Draft Article specifically mentions some spaces, the general nature of the language used in the Article was sufficient to cover a wide range of public spaces including those that were not specified in the Article’s text. Also, in addition to the clause in the Draft Article which allowed the state to make special provisions for women and children, there was a proposal to add a similar clause for Scheduled Castes and Tribes as well. This was not adopted – it was argued that this approach would perpetuate the segregation of Scheduled Castes and Tribes. The Article was adopted with some amendments.\n",

(1) No title shall be conferred by the State.(2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State.(3) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of the President, accept any present, emolument, title or office of any kind from or under any foreign StateArticle 18 (Draft Article 12) was debated on 30 November 1948 and 1 December 1948.The Constituent Assembly wasunanimous about the underlying principlebehind the Article: the continuation of titles in post-independentIndia would accentuate the problem of hierarchies in Indian society. From the debates, it was clear that the Article placed obligations on both the State and the citizen: the former to not recognise or confer a title and the later, to not accept one.The Assembly grappled with the question of implementation: what should be the consequences if a citizen accepts a title or the state recognised and conferred one? It was clarified that parliament could in the future pass laws that prescribed appropriate penalties and measures.Also, it was decided that titles related to military and academic distinction would be an exception to the Article. The Assembly then adopted the Article with amendment.\n",
