Azure\\ninfrastructure. If you are new to cloud computing, or Azure itself, this guide will help get you quickly\\nstarted with concepts, deployment, and management details. Many sections of this guide discuss an\\noperation such as deploying a virtual machine, and then provide a link for in-depth technical detail.\\nIntroduction to cloud computing and Microsoft Azure\\nCloud computing provides a modern alternative to the traditional on-premises datacenter. Public cloud\\nvendors provide and manage all computing infrastructure and the underlying management software.\\nThese vendors provide a wide variety of cloud services. A cloud service in this case might be a virtual\\nmachine, a web server, or cloud-hosted database engine. As a cloud provider customer, you lease these\\ncloud services on an as-needed basis. In doing so, you convert the capital expense of hardware\\nmaintenance into an operational expense. A cloud service also provides these benefits:\\n Rapid deployment of large compute environments\\n Rapid deallocation of systems that are no longer required\\n Easy deployment of traditionally complex systems like load balancers\\n Ability to provide flexible compute capacity or scale when needed\\n More cost-effective computing environments\\n Access from anywhere with a web-based portal or programmatic automation\\n Cloud-based services to meet most compute and application needs\\nWith on-premises infrastructure, you have complete control over the hardware and software that is\\ndeployed. Historically, this has led to hardware procurement decisions that focus on scaling up. An\\nexample is purchasing a server with more cores to satisfy peak performance needs. Unfortunately, this\\ninfrastructure might be underutilized outside a demand window. With Azure, you can deploy only the\\ninfrastructure that you need, and adjust this up or down at any time. This leads to a focus on scaling out\\nthrough the deployment of additional compute nodes to satisfy a performance need. Although this has\\nconsequences for the design of an appropriate software architecture, there is now ample proof that\\nscaling out the commodity of cloud services is more cost-effective than scaling up through expensive\\nMicrosoft has deployed many Azure datacenters around the globe, with more planned. Additionally,\\nMicrosoft is increasing sovereign clouds in regions like China and Germany. Only the largest global\\nenterprises can deploy datacenters in this manner, so using Azure makes it easy for enterprises of any\\nsize to deploy their services close to their customers.\\nFor small businesses, Azure allows for a low-cost entry point, with the ability to scale rapidly as demand\\nfor compute increases. This prevents a large up-front capital investment in infrastructure, and it\\nprovides the flexibility to architect and re-architect systems as needed. The use of cloud computing fits\\nwell with the scale-fast and fail-fast model of startup growth.\\nFor more information on the available Azure regions, see Azure regions.\\nCloud computing is usually classified into three categories: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.\\nSaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed. It’s usually based on a multitenant architecture—\\na single version of the application is used for all customers. It can be scaled out to multiple instances to\\nensure the best performance in all locations. SaaS software typically is licensed through a monthly or\\nMicrosoft Office 365 is a prototypical model of a SaaS offering. Subscribers pay a monthly or annual\\nsubscription fee, and they get Microsoft Exchange as a service (online and/or desktop Microsoft\\nOutlook), storage as a service (Microsoft OneDrive), and the rest of the Microsoft Office suite (online,\\nthe desktop version, or both). Subscribers always get the most recent version. So you can have an\\nExchange server without having to purchase a server and install and support Exchange—the Exchange\\nserver is managed for you. Compared to installing and upgrading Office every year, this is much less\\nexpensive and requires much less effort to keep updated.\\nWith PaaS, you deploy your application into an application-hosting environment that the cloud service\\nvendor provides. The developer provides the application, and the PaaS vendor provides the ability to\\ndeploy and run it. This frees developers from infrastructure management so they can focus on\\nAzure provides several PaaS compute offerings, including the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service\\nand Azure Cloud Services (web and worker roles). In either case, developers have multiple ways to\\ndeploy their application without knowing anything about the nuts and bolts that support it. Developers\\ndon’t have to create virtual machines (VMs), use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to sign in to each one,\\nor install the application. They just hit a button (or close to it), and the tools provided by Microsoft\\nprovision the VMs and then deploy and install the application on them.\\nIaaS: Infrastructure as a service\\nAn IaaS cloud vendor runs and manages all physical compute resources and the required software to\\nenable computer virtualization. A customer of this service deploys virtual machines in these hosted\\ndatacenters. Although the virtual machines are located in an offsite datacenter, the IaaS consumer has\\ncontrol over the configuration and management of them.\\nAzure includes several IaaS solutions, including Azure Virtual Machines, virtual machine scale sets, and\\nrelated networking infrastructure. Azure Virtual Machines is a popular choice for initially migrating\\nservices to Azure because it enables a “lift and shift” migration model. You can configure a VM like the\\ninfrastructure currently running your services in your datacenter, and then migrate your software to the\\nnew VM. You might need to make configuration updates, such as URLs to other services or storage, but\\nyou can migrate many applications in this way.\\nVirtual machine scale sets are built on top of Azure Virtual Machines and provide an easy way to deploy\\nclusters of identical VMs. Virtual machine scale sets also support autoscaling so that new VMs can be\\ndeployed automatically when required. This makes virtual machine scale sets an ideal platform to host\\nhigher-level microservice compute clusters, such as Azure Service Fabric and Azure Container Service.\\nAzure offers many services in its cloud computing platform. These services include the following.\\nServices for hosting and running application workload:\\n Azure Virtual Machines—both Linux and Windows\\n App Services (Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Logic Apps, API Apps, and Function Apps)\\n Azure Batch (for large-scale parallel and batch compute jobs)\\nServices for storing and managing data:\\n Azure Storage (comprises the Azure Blob, Queue, Table, and File services)\\nServices for building and operating applications:\\n Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)\\n Azure Service Bus for connecting distributed systems\\n Azure HDInsight for processing big data\\nServices for networking both within Azure and between Azure and on-premises datacenters:\\n Azure Content Delivery Network\\nFor detailed documentation on each of these services, as well as other Azure services, see Azure service\\nAzure is a global cloud platform that is generally available in many regions around the world. When you\\nprovision a service, application, or VM in Azure, you are asked to select a region. The selected region\\nrepresents a specific datacenter where your application runs. For more information, see Azure regions.\\nOne of the benefits of using Azure is that you can deploy your applications into a variety of datacenters\\naround the globe. The region you choose can affect the performance of your application. It’s optimal to\\nchoose a region that is closer to most your customers, to reduce latency in network requests. You might\\nalso select a region to meet the legal requirements for distributing your app in certain countries.\\nThe Azure portal is a web-based application that can be used to create, manage, and remove Azure\\nresources and services. The Azure portal is located at https://portal.azure.com. It includes a\\ncustomizable dashboard and tooling for managing Azure resources. It also provides billing and\\nsubscription information. For more information, see Microsoft Azure portal overview.\\nAzure resources are individual compute, networking, data, or app hosting servicesthat have been\\ndeployed into an Azure subscription. Some common resources are a virtual machines, storage accounts,\\nor SQL databases. Azure services often consist of several related Azure resources. For instance, an Azure\\nvirtual machine might include a VM, storage account, network adapter, and public IP address. All of\\nthese are individual resources. Each resource can be created, managed, and deleted individually or as a\\ngroup. Azure resources are covered in more detail later in this guide.\\nAn Azure resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource\\ngroup can include all the resources for the solution, or only resources that you want to manage as a\\ngroup. Azure resource groups are covered in more detail later in this guide.\\nAn Azure Resource Manager template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines one or\\nmore resources to deploy to a resource group. It also defines the dependencies between deployed\\nresources. Resource Manager templates are covered in more detail later in this guide.\\nIn addition to creating, managing, and deleting resources by using the Azure portal, you can automate\\nthese activities by using PowerShell or the Azure command-line interface (CLI).\\nAzure PowerShell is a set of modules that provide cmdlets to manage Azure. You can use the cmdlets to\\ncreate, manage, and remove Azure services. In most cases, you can use the cmdlets for the same tasks\\nthat you perform in the Azure portal. The cmdlets can help you can achieve consistent, repeatable, and\\nhands-off deployments. For more information, see How to install and configure Azure PowerShell.\\nThe Azure command-line interface is a tool that you can use to create, manage, and remove Azure\\nresources from the command line. The Azure CLI is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. For\\nmore information and technical details, see Install the Azure CLI.\\nAzure is built on a set of REST APIs that support the Azure portal UI. Most of these REST APIs are also\\nsupported to let you programmatically provision and manage your Azure resources and apps from any\\nInternet-enabled device. For more information, see the Azure REST SDK Reference.\\nGetting started with Azure subscriptions\\nA subscription is a logical grouping of Azure services that is linked to an Azure account. A singe Azure\\naccount can contain multiple subscriptions. Billing for Azure services is done on a per-subscription basis.\\nAzure subscriptions have an account administrator, who has full control over the subscription, and a\\nservice administrator, who has control over all services in the subscription. In addition to administrators,\\nindividual accounts can be granted detailed control of Azure resources through RBAC.\\nSelect and enable an Azure subscription\\nBefore you can work with Azure services, you need a subscription. Several subscription types are\\nFree accounts: The link to sign up for a free account is on the Azure website. This gives you a $200 credit\\nover the course of 30 days to try any combination of resources in Azure. If you exceed your credit\\namount, your account will be suspended. At the end of the trial, your services will be decommissioned\\nand will no longer work. You can upgrade this to a pay-as-you-go subscription at any time.\\nMSDN subscriptions: If you have an MSDN subscription, you get a specific amount in Azure credit each\\nmonth. For example, if you have a Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise with MSDN subscription, you get\\n$150 per month in Azure credit.\\nIf you exceed the credit amount, your service will be disabled until the next month starts. You can turn\\noff the spending limit and add a credit card to be used for the additional costs. Some of these costs are\\ndiscounted for MSDN accounts. For example, you pay the Linux price for VMs running Windows Server,\\nand there is no additional charge for Microsoft servers such as Microsoft SQL Server. This makes MSDN\\naccounts ideal for development and test scenarios.\\nBizSpark accounts: The Microsoft BizSpark program provides a lot of benefits to startups. One of those\\nbenefits is access to all the Microsoft software for development and test environments for up to five\\nMSDN accounts. You get $150 in Azure credit for each of those five MSDN accounts, and you pay\\nreduced rates for several of the Azure services, such as Virtual Machines.\\nPay-as-you-go: With this subscription, you pay for what you use by attaching a credit card or debit card\\nto the account. If you are an organization, you can also be approved for invoicing.\\nEnterprise agreements: With an enterprise agreement, you commit to using a certain amount of\\nservices in Azure over the next year, and you pay that amount ahead of time. The commitment that you\\nmake is consumed throughout the year. If you exceed the commitment amount, you can pay the\\noverage in arrears. Depending on the amount of the commitment, you get a discount on the services in\\nFor more information and to create an Azure subscription, see How to sign up, purchase, upgrade, or\\nGrant administrative access to an Azure subscription\\nMultiple account administrator roles are available and can be changed at any time. Two key roles are:\\n Service administrator: This role is authorized to manage Azure services. By default, it’s granted\\naccess to the same account as the account administrator.\\n Co-administrator: This role has the same access as the service administrator. However, this role\\ncannot change the association of a subscription to Azure directories.\\nFor more information, see How to add or change Azure administrator roles.\\nView billing information in the Azure portal\\nAn important component of using Azure is the ability to view billing information. The Azure portal\\nprovides detailed insight into Azure billing information.\\nFor more information, see How to download your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data.\\nGet billing information from billing APIs\\nIn addition to viewing the billing in the portal, you can access the billing information by using a script or\\nprogram through the Azure Billing REST APIs:\\n You can use the Azure Usage API to retrieve your usage data. You can fine-tune the billing usage\\ninformation by tagging related Azure resources. For example, you can tag each of the resources\\nin a resource group with a department name or project name, and then track the costs\\n You can use the Azure Rate Card API to list all the available resources, along with the metadata\\nand pricing information about each of those resources.\\nFor more information, see Gain insights into your Microsoft Azure resource consumption.\\nForecast cost with the pricing calculator\\nThe pricing for each service in Azure is different. Many Azure services provide Basic, Standard, and\\nPremium tiers. Usually, each tier has several price and performance levels. By using the online pricing\\ncalculator, you can create pricing estimates. The calculator includes flexibility to estimate cost on a\\nsingle resource or a group of resources.\\nAfter you have deployed your application or solution on Azure, you can create alerts that send you email\\nwhen you approach spending limits defined in the alert. For more information, see Set up billing alerts\\nfor your Microsoft Azure subscriptions.\\nAzure Resource Manager is a deployment, management, and organization mechanism for Azure\\nresources. By using Resource Manager, you can put many individual resources together in a resource\\nResource Manager also includes deployment capabilities that allow for customizable deployment and\\nconfiguration of related resources. For instance, by using Resource Manager, you can deploy an\\napplication that consists of multiple virtual machines, a load balancer, and a SQL database as a single\\nunit. You develop these deployments by using a Resource Manager template.\\nResource Manager provides several benefits:\\n You can deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than\\nhandling these resources individually.\\n You can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have\\nconfidence that your resources are deployed in a consistent state.\\n You can manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.\\n You can define the dependencies between resources so they are deployed in the correct order.\\n You can apply access control to all services in your resource group because RBAC is natively\\nintegrated into the management platform.\\n You can apply tags on resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.\\n You can clarify your organization’s billing by viewing costs for a group of resources that share\\nTips for creating resource groups\\nWhen you’re making decisions about your resource groups, consider these tips:\\n All the resources in a resource group should have the same lifecycle.\\n You can assign a resource to only one group at a time.\\n You can add or remove a resource from a resource group at any time. Every resource must\\nbelong to a resource group. So if you remove a resource from one group, you must add it to\\n You can move most types of resources to a different resource group at any time.\\n The resources in a resource group can be in different regions.\\n You can use a resource group to control access for the resources in it.\\nBuilding Resource Manager templates\\nResource Manager templates declaratively define the resources and resource configurations that will be\\ndeployed into a single resource group. You can use Resource Manager templates to orchestrate complex\\ndeployments without the need for excess scripting or manual configuration. After you develop a\\ntemplate, you can deploy it multiple times—each time with an identical outcome.\\nA Resource Manager template consists of four sections:\\n Parameters: These are inputs to the deployment. Parameter values can be provided by a human\\nor an automated process. An example parameter might be an admin user name and password\\nfor a Windows VM. The parameter values will be used throughout the deployment when they’re\\n Variables: These are used to hold values that are used throughout the deployment. Unlike\\nparameters, a variable value is not provided at deployment time. Instead, it’s hard coded or\\n Resources: This section of the template defines the resources to be deployed, such as virtual\\nmachines, storage accounts, and virtual networks.\\n Output: After a deployment has finished, Resource Manager can return data such as\\ndynamically generated connection strings.\\nThe following mechanisms are available for deployment automation:\\n Functions: You can use several functions in Resource Manager templates. These include\\noperations such as converting a string to lowercase, deploying multiple instances of a defined\\nresource, and dynamically returning the target resource group. Resource Manager functions\\nhelp build dynamic deployments.\\n Resource dependencies: When you’re deploying multiple resources, some resources will have a\\ndependency on others. To facilitate deployment, you can use a dependency declaration so that\\ndependent resources are deployed before the others.\\n Template linking: From within one Resource Manager template, you can link to another\\ntemplate. This allows deployment decomposition into a set of targeted, purpose-specific\\nYou can build Resource Manager templates in any text editor. However, the Azure SDK for Visual Studio\\nincludes tooling to assist in the creation process. By using Visual Studio, you can add resources to the\\ntemplate through a wizard. You can then deploy and debug the template directly from the Visual Studio\\nIDE. For more information, see Authoring Azure Resource Manager templates.\\nFinally, you can convert existing resource groups into a reusable template from the Azure portal. This\\ncan be helpful if you want to create a deployable template of an existing resource group, or you just\\nwant to examine the underlying JSON. To export a resource group, select the Automation Script button\\nfrom the resource group’s settings.\\nSecurity of Azure resources (RBAC)\\nYou can grant operational access to user accounts at a specified scope: subscription, resource group, or\\nindividual resource. This means you can deploy a set of resources into a resource group, such as a virtual\\nmachine and all related resources, and grant permissions to a specific user or group. This approach\\nlimits access to only the resources that belong to the target resource group. You can also grant access to\\na single resource, such as a virtual machine or a virtual network.\\nTo grant access, you assign a role to the user or user group. There are many predefined roles. You can\\nalso define your own custom roles.\\nHere are a few example roles built into Azure:\\n Owner: A user with this role can manage everything, including access.\\n Reader: A user with this role can read resources of all types (except secrets) but can’t make\\n Virtual machine contributor: A user with this role can manage virtual machines but can’t\\nmanage the virtual network to which they are connected or the storage account where the VHD\\n SQL DB contributor: A user with this role can manage SQL databases but not their securityrelated policies.\\n SQL security manager: A user with this role can manage the security-related policies of SQL\\n Storage account contributor: A user with this role can manage storage accounts but cannot\\nmanage access to the storage accounts.\\nFor more information, see Use role assignments to manage access to your Azure subscription resources.\\nAzure Virtual Machines is one of the central IaaS services in Azure. Azure Virtual Machines supports the\\ndeployment of Windows or Linux virtual machines in a Microsoft Azure datacenter. With Azure Virtual\\nMachines, you have total control over the VM configuration and are responsible for all software\\ninstallation, configuration, and maintenance.\\nWhen you’re deploying an Azure VM, you can select an image from the Azure Marketplace, or you can\\nprovide you own generalized image. This image will be used to apply the operating system and initial\\nconfiguration. During the deployment, Resource Manager will handle some configuration settings, such\\nas assigning the computer name, administrative credentials, and network configuration. You can use\\nAzure virtual machine extensions to further automate configurations such as software installation,\\nantivirus configuration, and monitoring solutions.\\nYou can create virtual machines in many different sizes. The size of virtual machine dictates resource\\nallocation such as processing, memory, and storage capacity. In some cases, specific features such as\\nRDMA-enabled network adapters and SSD disks are available only with certain VM sizes. For a complete\\nlist of VM sizes and capabilities, see “Sizes for virtual machines in Azure” for Windows and Linux.\\nBecause Azure virtual machines offer complete control over configuration, they are ideal for a wide\\nrange of server workloads that do not fit into a PaaS model. Server workloads such as database servers\\n(SQL Server, Oracle, or MongoDB), Windows Server Active Directory, Microsoft SharePoint, and many\\nmore become possible to run on the Microsoft Azure platform. If desired, you can move such workloads\\nfrom an on-premises datacenter to one or more Azure regions, without a large amount of\\nYou can deploy Azure virtual machines by using the Azure portal, by using automation with the Azure\\nPowerShell module, or by using automation with the cross-platform CLI.\\nDeploying a virtual machine by using the Azure portal requires only an active Azure subscription and\\naccess to a web browser. You can select many different operating system images with varying\\nconfigurations. All storage and networking requirements are configured during the deployment. For\\nmore information, see “Create your first Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal” for Windows and\\nIn addition to deploying a virtual machine from the Azure portal, you can deploy an Azure Resource\\nManager template from the portal. This will deploy and configure all resources as defined in the\\ntemplate. For more information, see Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure\\nDeploying an Azure virtual machine by using PowerShell allows for complete deployment automation of\\nall related virtual machine resources, including storage and networking. For more information, see\\nCreate a Windows VM using Resource Manager and PowerShell.\\nIn addition to deploying Azure compute resources individually, you can use the Azure PowerShell\\nmodule to deploy an Azure Resource Manager template. This provides automation to start the\\ndeployment action while retaining all benefits of modeling a deployment by using Resource Manager\\ntemplates. For more information, see Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure\\nAs with the PowerShell module, the Azure command-line interface provides deployment automation\\nand can be used on Windows, OS X, or Linux systems. When you’re using the Azure CLI vm quick-create\\ncommand, all related virtual machine resources (including storage and networking) and the virtual\\nmachine itself are deployed. For more information, see Create a Linux VM in Azure by using the CLI.\\nLikewise, you can use the Azure CLI to deploy an Azure Resource Manager template. This provides\\nautomation to start the deployment action while retaining all benefits of modeling a deployment by\\nusing Resource Manager templates. For more information, see Deploy resources with Resource\\nManager templates and Azure CLI.\\nAccess and security for virtual machines\\nAccessing a virtual machine from the Internet requires the associated network interface, or load\\nbalancer if applicable, to be configured with a public IP address. The public IP address includes a DNS\\nname that will resolve to the virtual machine or load balancer. For more information, see IP addresses in\\nYou manage access to the virtual machine over the public IP address by using a network security group\\n(NSG) resource. An NSG acts like a firewall and allows or denies traffic across the network interface or\\nsubnet on a set of defined ports. For instance, to create a Remote Desktop session with an Azure VM,\\nyou need to configure the NSG to allow inbound traffic on port 3389. For more information, see Opening\\nports to a VM in Azure using the Azure portal.\\nFinally, as with the management of any computer system, you should provide security for an Azure\\nvirtual machine at the operating system by using security credentials and software firewalls. \\nAzure Storage is a Microsoft-managed service that provides durable, scalable, and redundant storage.\\nYou can add an Azure storage account as a resource to any resource group by using any resource\\ndeployment method. Azure includes four storage types: Blob storage, File Storage, Table storage, and\\nQueue storage. When deploying a storage account, two account types are available, General-purpose\\nand Blob storage. A General purpose storage account gives you access to all four storage types. Blob\\nstorage accounts are similar to general-purpose accounts, but contain specialized blobs that include hot\\nand cold access tiers. For more information on Blob storage, see Azure Blob storage.\\nAzure storage accounts can be configured with different levels of redundancy:\\n Locally redundant storage provides high availability by ensuring that three copies of all data are\\nmade synchronously before a write is deemed successful. These copies are stored in a single\\nfacility in a single region. The replicas reside in separate fault domains and upgrade domains.\\nThis means the data is available even if a storage node that’s holding your data fails or is taken\\n Geo-redundant storage makes three synchronous copies of the data in the primary region for\\nhigh availability, and then asynchronously makes three replicas in a paired region for disaster\\n Read-access geo-redundant storage is geo-redundant storage plus the ability to read the data in\\nthe secondary region. This ability makes it suitable for partial disaster recovery. If there’s a\\nproblem with the primary region, you can change your application to have read-only access to\\nEach storage type has a different use case.\\nThe word blob is an acronym for binary large object. Blobs are unstructured files like those that you\\nstore on your computer. Blob storage can store any type of text or binary data, such as a document,\\nmedia file, or application installer. Blob storage is also referred to as object storage. Azure Blob storage\\nalso holds Azure Virtual Machines data disks.\\nAzure Storage supports three kinds of blobs:\\n Block blobs are used to hold ordinary files up to 195 GB in size (4 MB × 50,000 blocks). The\\nprimary use case for block blobs is the storage of files that are read from beginning to end, such\\nas media files or image files for websites. They are named block blobs because files larger than\\n64 MB must be uploaded as small blocks. These blocks are then consolidated (or committed)\\n Page blobs are used to hold random-access files up to 1 TB in size. Page blobs are used primarily\\nas the backing storage for the VHDs that provide durable disks for Azure Virtual Machines, the\\nIaaS compute service in Azure. They are named page blobs because they provide random\\nread/write access to 512-byte pages.\\n Append blobs consist of blocks like block blobs, but they are optimized for append operations.\\nThese are frequently used for logging information from one or more sources to the same blob.\\nFor example, you might write all of your trace logging to the same append blob for an\\napplication that’s running on multiple VMs. A single append blob can be up to 195 GB.\\nFor more information, see Get started with Azure Blob storage.\\nAzure File storage is a service that offers file shares in the cloud by using the standard Server Message\\nBlock (SMB) protocol. The service supports both SMB 2.1 and SMB 3.0. With Azure File storage, you can\\nmigrate applications that rely on file shares to Azure quickly and without costly rewrites. Applications\\nrunning on Azure virtual machines, in cloud services, or from on-premises clients can mount a file share\\nin the cloud. This is similar to how a desktop application mounts a typical SMB share. Any number of\\napplication components can then mount and access the File storage share simultaneously.\\nBecause a File storage share is a standard SMB file share, applications running in Azure can access data\\nin the share via file system I/O APIs. Developers can therefore use their existing code and skills to\\nmigrate existing applications. IT pros can use PowerShell cmdlets to create, mount, and manage File\\nstorage shares as part of the administration of Azure applications.\\nFor more information, see Get started with Azure File storage.\\nAzure Table storage is a service that stores structured NoSQL data in the cloud. Table storage is a\\nkey/attribute store with a schema-less design. Because Table storage is schema-less, it's easy to adapt\\nyour data as the needs of your application evolve. Access to data is fast and cost-effective for all kinds of\\napplications. Table storage is typically significantly lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes\\nYou can use Table storage to store flexible datasets, such as user data for web applications, address\\nbooks, device information, and any other type of metadata that your service requires. You can store any\\nnumber of entities in a table. A storage account can contain any number of tables, up to the capacity\\nFor more information, see Get started with Azure Table storage.\\nAzure Queue storage provides cloud messaging between application components. In designing\\napplications for scale, application components are often decoupled so that they can scale\\nindependently. Queue storage delivers asynchronous messaging for communication between\\napplication components, whether they are running in the cloud, on the desktop, on an on-premises\\nserver, or on a mobile device. Queue storage also supports managing asynchronous tasks and building\\nFor more information, see Get started with Azure Queue storage.\\nDeploying a storage account by using the Azure portal requires only an active Azure subscription and\\naccess to a web browser. You can deploy a new storage account into a new or existing resource group.\\nAfter you’ve created the storage account, you can create a blob container or file share by using the\\nportal. You can create Table and Queue storage entities programmatically.\\nIn addition to deploying a storage account from the Azure portal, you can deploy an Azure Resource\\nManager template from the portal. This will deploy and configure all resources as defined in the\\ntemplate, including any storage accounts. For more information, see Deploy resources with Resource\\nManager templates and Azure portal.\\nDeploying an Azure storage account by using PowerShell allows for complete deployment automation of\\nthe storage account. For more information, see Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Storage.\\nIn addition to deploying Azure resources individually, you can use the Azure PowerShell module to\\ndeploy an Azure Resource Manager template.

This provides\\nautomation to start the deployment action while retaining all benefits of modeling a deployment by\\nusing Resource Manager templates. For more information, see Deploy resources with Resource\\nManager templates and Azure CLI.\\nAccess and security for Azure Storage\\nAzure Storage is accessed in a variety of ways, including though the Azure portal, during VM creation\\nand operation, and from Storage client libraries. This section will detail a few of these.\\nWhen you’re deploying a virtual machine, you also need to create a storage account to hold the virtual\\nmachine operating system disk and any additional data disks. You can select an existing storage account\\nor create a new one. Because the maximum size of a blob is 1,024 GB, a single VM disk has a maximum\\nsize of 1,023 GB. To configure a larger data disk, you can present multiple data disks to the virtual\\nmachine and pool them together as a single logical disk. For more information, see “Storage\\ninfrastructure guidelines” for Windows and Linux.\\nAzure storage accounts can be accessed through many different storage explorers, such as Visual Studio\\nCloud Explorer. These tools provide the ability to browse through storage accounts and data. For more\\ninformation and a list of available storage explorers, see Azure Storage client tools.\\nStorage resources can be accessed by any language that can make HTTP/HTTPS requests. Additionally,\\nAzure Storage offers programming libraries for several popular languages. These libraries simplify many\\naspects of working with Azure Storage by handling details such as synchronous and asynchronous\\ninvocation, batching of operations, exception management, automatic retries, and operational behavior.\\nFor more information, see Azure Storage service REST API reference.\\nEach storage account has two authentication keys, a primary and a secondary. Either of these can be\\nused for storage access operations. These storage keys are used to help secure a storage account and\\nare required for programmatically accessing data. There are two keys to allow occasional rollover of the\\nkeys to enhance security. It is critical to keep these secure because their possession, along with the\\naccount name, allows unlimited access to any data in the storage account.\\nIf you need to allow users to have controlled access to your storage resources, you can create a shared\\naccess signature. A shared access signature is a token that can be appended to a URL that enables\\ndelegated access to a storage resource. Anyone who possesses the token can access the resource that it\\npoints to with the permissions that it specifies, for the period of time that it’s valid. For more\\ninformation, see Using shared access signatures.\\nVirtual networks are necessary to support communications between virtual machines. You can define\\nsubnets, custom IP address, DNS settings, security filtering, and load balancing. By using a VPN gateway\\nor an ExpressRoute circuit, you can connect Azure virtual networks to your on-premises networks.\\nAn Azure virtual network, by default, is accessible only to resources stored in Azure. Resources\\nconnected to the same virtual network can communicate with each other. You can associate virtual\\nmachine network interfaces and load balancers with a public IP address to make the virtual machine\\naccessible over the Internet. You can help secure access to the publicly exposed resources by using a\\nCross-premises virtual networks\\nYou can connect an on-premises network to an Azure virtual network by using ExpressRoute or a site-tosite VPN connection. In this configuration, the Azure virtual network is essentially a cloud-based\\nextension of your on-premises network.\\nBecause the Azure virtual network is connected to your on-premises network, cross-premises virtual\\nnetworks must use a unique portion of the address space that your organization uses. In the same way\\nthat different corporate locations are assigned a specific IP subnet, Azure becomes another location as\\nDeploying an Azure virtual network by using the Azure portal requires only an active Azure subscription\\nand access to a web browser. You can deploy a new virtual network into a new or existing resource\\ngroup. When you’re creating a new virtual machine from the portal, you can select an existing virtual\\nnetwork or a create a new one.

For more information, see Deploy resources with Resource\\nManager templates and Azure CLI.\\nAccess and security for virtual networks\\nYou can help secure Azure virtual networks by using a network security group. NSGs contain a list of\\naccess control list (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to your VM instances in a virtual\\nnetwork. You can associate NSGs with either subnets or individual VM instances within that subnet.\\nWhen you associate an NSG with a subnet, the ACL rules apply to all the VM instances in that subnet. In\\naddition, you can further restrict traffic to an individual VM by associating an NSG directly with that VM.\\nFor more information, see What is a Network Security Group?.\n",
