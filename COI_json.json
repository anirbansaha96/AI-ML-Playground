It is the core and gateways provision of the right to religious freedom section of the Constitution.The mention of freedom to propagate religion triggered some conflict in the Assembly. Some members were concerned that it could facilitate conversions \u2013 forced andvoluntary. Others argued that the propagation of religion did not mean forced or violent conversions. Further, it was notedthatthe free propagation of religion couldlead to different religious communities learning about each other\u2019s religions, thereby promoting understanding and peace.An important strand of the debate centred around the sub-clause which threw open Hindu religious institutions to any class or section of Hindus. A member wanted the scope of the Article to extend beyond Hindus to Buddhists, Jains and Christians. Another member proposed that \u2018any class or section\u2026\u2019 be replaced \u2018all classes\u2026\u2019 to include a larger range of religious institutions.The Assembly adopted the Article with some amendments.(In 1949, the Assembly passed an amendment that brought Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs)", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 6 Rights of citizenship of certain persons who have migrated to India from Pakistan.txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 6 Rights of citizenship of certain persons who have migrated to India from PakistanNotwithstanding anything in article 5, a person who has migrated to the territory of India from the territory now included in Pakistan shall be deemed to be a citizen of India at the commencement of this Constitution if \u2014   (a) he or either of his parents or any of his grandparents was born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935 (as originally enacted); and    (b) (i) in the case where such person has so migrated before the nineteenth day of July, 1948, he has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India since the date of his migration, or          (ii) in the case where such person has so migrated on or after the nineteenth day of July, 1948, he has been registered as a citizen of India by an officer appointed in that behalf by the Government   ofthe Dominion of India on an application made by him therefor to such officer before the commencement of this Constitution in the form and manner prescribed by that Government:Provided that no person shall be so registered unless he has been resident in the territory of India for at least six months immediately preceding the date of his application.Debate SummaryArticle 6 of the Constitution of India (Article 5A of the Draft Constitution) lays down principles of citizenship with regards to persons who migrated from Pakistan to India during partition.This article was debated on10thAugust 1949,11thAugust 1949and12thAugust 1949.The two crucial strands of this debate were to make the intent explicit and to include strong requirements of evidence to acquire citizenship.Some members proposed to add \u2018on account of Civil disturbance or the fear of such disturbances\u2019 in the first clause. It was argued that the inclusion of this phrase would articulate and make explicit the real intention behind this provision which was to facilitate migration from Pakistan in the wake of civil disturbance or fear of it.Another member wanted make it compulsory to provide evidence to prove right by descent and intention to permanently reside in India. He argued that Indian citizenship must be regarded as a matter of great privilege and a cheap or easy affair.The members of the Drafting Committee reminded the Assembly that this Article sought to settle basic principles of citizenship and did not aim to establish a \u2018code of nationality law\u2019. One member went on to say that compared to the Indian constitution, no other constitution even made an attempt to comprehensively deal with various aspects of nationality law.Towards the end of the debate, some members voluntarily withdrew their amendments, while other amendmentswhich were put to vote were not accepted.The Constituent AssemblyadoptedDraft Article 5A as introduced by the Drafting Committee on12thAugust 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 188 Oath or affirmation by members..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 188 Oath or affirmation by members.Every member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council of a State shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the Governor, or some person appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 85 Sessions of Parliament, prorogation and dissolution..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 85 Sessions of Parliament, prorogation and dissolution.(1) The President shall from time to time summon each House of Parliament to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit, but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session.(2) The President may from time to time \u2014(a) prorogue the Houses or either House;(b) dissolve the House of the People.Debate SummaryArticle 69, Draft Constitution 1948(1) The Houses of Parliament shall be summoned to meet twice at least in every year, and six months shall not intervene between their last sitting in one session and the date appointed for their first sitting in the next session.(2) Subject to the provisions of this article, the President may from time to time-(a) Summon the Houses or either House of Parliament to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit;(b) Prorogue the Houses;(c) Dissolve the House of the People.Draft Article 69 (Article 85, Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on 18 May 1949. It regulated the sessions of the Parliaments, its prorogation and dissolution.A member proposed an amendment to replace \u2018six months\u2019 to \u2018three months\u2019 in clause 1. This would ensure that the Parliament met more often and spend more time on its business. He further sought to add a proviso to clause 1 to treat the Parliament\u2019s annual session as \u2018as a continuous single annual session\u2019. Another member moved an amendment to replace \u2018twice\u2019 to \u2018thrice\u2019 in clause 1. He accused the Drafting Committee of mindlessly copying this provision from the Government of India Act, 1935, without taking into account the nature of new, independent India\u2019s polity. In support of this amendment, a member highlighted how during the budget session of the Parliament, other legislative matters were sidestepped. Having compulsory three sessions would allow the Parliament to attend to more legislative work. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that the Draft Article did not prohibit the Parliament from meeting frequently. This provision merely ensured minimum parliamentary sittings. He believed that the Parliamentwould meet so often that the members would \u2018probably themselves get tired of the sessions\u2019. Moreover, the Parliament was not only responsible for ensuring \u2018good administration\u2019 but also to be responsible to the people and give effect to the majority government\u2019s party mandate.There was a proposal to allow either the Speaker of the House of the People or the Chairman of the Council of States to summon his/her respective houses in case the President failed to do so in three months. Coming from a place of suspicion in the President\u2019s role, he argued that the Constitution must be prepared for all future contingencies. This amendment would ensure that the business of the Parliament could be carried as usual. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee did not believe that a President would disobey a constitutionally laid down obligation. Indeed, if he/she refused to convene the meeting then this would be a sufficient ground to impeach him/her.The Assembly did not accept these proposals.

It lays down the procedure and conditions through which a vacancy in the office of President is filled. There were only two objections to the Article. The first was related to the second part of Clause 2 that set out the newly elected President\u2019s term: a newly elected President would serve a term of 5 years irrespective of how long the old president served in office. This would lead to the parliament\u2019s and the President\u2019s terms to not run in parallel. This bothered a member who felt that the two terms must run in parallel to avoid the President influencing elections to the Parliament. Another member said that the Draft Article made inadequate arrangements for the interim period that lay between the removal/death/resignation of a President and the installation of a new President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded to these concerns. He first argued that there was no reason why a newly elected President must serve a term less than five years. Second, he said that the interim period between the old and the new President was taken care of by Draft Article 54.The Draft Article was adopted without amendment.

It laid down grounds for disqualification of the members of the Parliament.A member moved an amendment to delete sub-clause (e) of clause 1. He argued that this Draft Article laid down comprehensive grounds of disqualification of the members of parliament, empowering the future parliaments to expand on these grounds would be \u2018dangerous\u2019. Political parties might use this to disqualify their opponents. Another member echoed a similar view \u2013 he strongly urged for not giving the future Parliaments power to add to the list of disqualifications. Further, he proposed a set of additional grounds that included conviction based on offences relating elections, moral turpitude. In rebuttal to this, a member believed that the future legislature would not abuse its lawmaking power under this provision. He argued that a legitimate Parliament which represented the will of the people should have the liberty to legislateon this matter.A member was concerned with the phrasing of sub-clause (b) of clause 1 and favoured deletion of \u2018declared by a competent court\u2019.

Before the Assembly took up the Draft Article, the Drafting Committee moved an amendment that pegged the Assembly\u2019s discussions. The core conflict that emerged around the amendment was placing of State Legislature elections under the purview of the Central Commission. This was a radical departure from the Draft Article 289 that put State Legislature elections under a State Commission appointed by the State Governor. The reason for the change, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued, was that there were reports that non-native citizens of a State were being discriminated against by State government agencies and this could have a detrimental effect on the independence and impartiality of the State Commission. This argument was not taken well by some members of the Assembly who felt that the centralisation of election machinery was not an answer to undemocratic practices and the discrimination of minorities in a State. They felt that the Draft Article further diluted the federal idea. The federalism argument was countered by other members who did not see the Draft Article impinging on federalism as governments, state or central, have nothing to do with elections at all. On the role of the President of India, the Assembly felt that the Drafting Committee\u2019s amendment placed the President at a powerful position with regards to elections and in order to counter the possibility of the Central government influencing the President, it was decided that certain aspects of the Draft Article would be made subject to law made by parliament. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article incorporating amendments, including the one moved by the Drafting Committee.

It created a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor.A member proposed that clause (1) be amended so that the Council could aid and advise the Governor even in the exercise of his discretionary powers. He argued that this gave the Governor more authority than the President in relation to the Council\u2019s advice. He further contended that it violated the principles of constitutional government to invest the Governor with wide discretionary powers. A member of the Drafting Committee clarified that the Governor would be bound to act on the advice of the Council except on those matters which explicitly came under his discretionary powers under Draft Article 188. He pointed out that the present Draft Article could be later revised if the Assembly decided to remove discretionary powers altogether during the debate on Draft Article 188.A member proposed to an amendment to explicitly state that the Chief Minister, as the head of the Council, would be responsible to the Governor. He argued that the Constitution was based on the principle of the executive\u2019s responsibility to the legislature. Since the Chief Minister would be heading the Council and adjudicating on matters of great importance, it was necessary for him to be \u2018directly responsible for any advice tendered to the Constitutional head of the State.\u2019 One member agreed with this, expressing concern that the Draft Article only required the Council to render advice to the Governor, and did not bind the latter to act on it. Another member disagreed, arguing that there may be many situations in which the advice of the Council may not be appropriate.Both amendments were negatived by the Assembly.

The Draft Article placedthe executive power of the Union with the President of India.One member proposed to make it explicit in the Article that the President\u2019s executive power was subject to the advice and help of the Union Government. This would reiterateand make it clear that the Assembly had adopted a parliamentary systemof government and not a presidential one.Another member wanted to include'on behalf of the people of India'in the first clause to signalthat sovereignty and popular will laywith the people. Unlike the Government of India act 1935, he continued,that enabled the Governor-General to exercise executive power on behalf of the 'King-Emperor of India', the Indian Constitution should mention that executive power was exercised on behalf of the people.There was another proposal thatexhaustively listedout all the powers and responsibilities of the President. The member who proposed thisargued that for a new nation like India, the President's powers must be clearly laid out in the Constitution to avoid any ambiguities. Several members opposed this move: a member of the Drafting Committee pointed out that theproposal wentagainst the decision of the Assembly to adopt a parliamentary form of democracy.The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 10 December 1948 without any amendments. However, the Constituent Assembly reopened discussionson 16 October 1949.The Drafting Committee moved a minor amendment which enabled the President to exercise his power even through his subordinates. Some members feltthat this amendment was redundant and unnecessary. They argued that it was understood that the President would be exercising his power through his \u2018agents\u2019. As one member put it \u2018This attempt to clarify things is grossly exaggerating the idea of going into details\u2019.The members of the Drafting Committee responded by highlighting that the President would not really exercise his executive power himself;He would \u2018simplyexercisethem at the dictation of other people who are responsible tothe legislature\u2019 and the amendment embodied and clarifiedthis scheme.The Assembly accepted the amendment and adopted the Draft Article.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 7 Rights of citizenship of certain migrants to Pakistan..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 7 Rights of citizenship of certain migrants to Pakistan.Notwithstanding anything in articles 5 and 6, a person who has after the first day of March, 1947, migrated from the territory of India to the territory now included in Pakistan shall not be deemed to be a citizen of India:Provided that nothing in this article shall apply to a person who, after having so migrated to the territory now included in Pakistan, has returned to the territory of India under a permit for resettlement or permanent return issued by or under the authority of any law and every such person shall for the purposes of clause (b) of article 6 be deemed to have migrated to the territory of India after the nineteenth day of July, 1948.Debate SummaryArticle 7 (Article 5AA of the Draft Constitution) regulates citizenship claims of persons who have migrated to Pakistan.This article was debated on10thAugust 1949,11thAugust 1949and12thAugust 1949.During the debates, some Assembly Memberswere concerned about the permit system and the effect that this article would have on property rights.The partition of India and Pakistan triggered migration between India and Pakistan. The Government of India passed an ordinance on 19th July 1948 to set up a permit system for persons migrating from Pakistan to India. This offered three types of permits: temporary, permanent and resettlement. Persons with resettlement permits could claim citizenship rights under this article.Some members thought that this article was \u2018obnoxious\u2019 because once persons migrate from India to Pakistan they would have \u2018transferred their loyalty\u2019 to another country. The permit system treats these persons favourably and makes it easier to obtain Indian citizenship. Instead, it was argued that migrants from Pakistan should be treated like other foreigners and they could acquire citizenship from naturalization. However, others responded to this argument by pointing out that the local officers, who are tasked with issuing the permit systems, carefully examine each case. Permits are not issues in a lackadaisical manner. Further, the members of the Drafting Committee reminded the Assembly that the Indian government had promised rehabilitation and resettlement measures for migrants from Pakistan. And put in place a permit system for citizenship claims. Going back on these words would be \u2018invidious\u2019 and cause \u2018grossest injustice\u2019. Some were concerned with the conflict between this article and property rights. One member argued that the property left behind by migrants was treated as \u2018evacuee property\u2019 under the law. Upon a person\u2019s return and subsequent acquisition of Indian citizenship, how will their property claims be settled?A member from the Drafting Committee clarified that there was no relationship between citizenship and property rights either in international or domestic law. He noted: \u2018Nationality or citizenship has nothing to do with the law of property\u2019.The Assembly adopted this article without any amendments on 12 August 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 190 Vacation of seats..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 190 Vacation of seats.(1) No person shall be a member of both Houses of the Legislature of a State and provision shall be made by the Legislature of the State by law for the vacation by a person who is chosen a member of both Houses of his seat in one house or the other.(2) No person shall be a member of the Legislatures of two or more States specified in the First Schedule and if a person is chosen a member of the Legislatures of two or more such States, then, at the expiration of such period as may be specified in rules1 made by the President, that person's seat in the Legislatures of all such States shall become vacant, unless he has previously resigned his seat in the Legislatures of all but one of the States.(3) If a member of a House of the Legislature of a State \u2014(a) becomes subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in clause (1) or clause (2) of article 191; or(b) resigns his seat by writing under his hand addressed to the speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, and his resignation is accepted by the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be,his seat shall thereupon become vacant: Provided that in the case of any resignation referred to in sub-clause (b), if from information received or otherwise and after making such inquiry as he thinks fit, the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, is satisfied that such resignation is not voluntary or genuine, he shall not accept such resignation.(4) If for a period of sixty days a member of a House of the Legislature of a State is without permission of the House absent from all meetings thereof, the House may declare his seat vacant: Provided that in computing the said period of sixty days no account shall be taken of any period during which the House is prorogued or is adjourned for more than four consecutive days.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 243H Powers to impose taxes by, and Funds of, the Panchayats..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 243H Powers to impose taxes by, and Funds of, the Panchayats.The Legislature of a State may, by law, \u2014(a) authorise a Panchayat to levy, collect and appropriate such taxes, duties, tolls and fees in accordance with such procedure and subject to such limits;(b) assign to a Panchayat such taxes, duties, tolls and fees levied and collected by the State Government for such purposes and subject to such conditions and limits;(c) provide for making such grants-in-aid to the Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of the State; and(d) provide for constitution of such Funds for crediting all moneys received, respectively, by or on behalf of the Panchayats and also for the withdrawal of such moneys therefrom,as may be specified in the law.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 31  Compulsory acquisition of property..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 31  Compulsory acquisition of property.[Compulsory acquisition of property.] Rep. by the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, s. 6 (w.e.f. 20-6-1979).Debate SummaryArticle 24 of the Draft Constitution (Article 31 of the Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on September 10, 1949 and September 12, 1949.

Through this Amendment, the Drafting Committee sought to give primacy to the Parliament, in particular the House of the People.A member believed that the amendment inflicted \u2018unnecessary formality\u2019 to the procedure. He pointed out that the House of Commons adopted the passing of the Act route, as its votes had no legal validity. The amendment introduced voting in the House of the People along with the passing of an Appropriation Bill. This would be superfluous and time-consuming. Another member rebutted these concerns. He viewed this double-layered process as a measure of ensuring scrutiny.A member of the Drafting Committee defended the amendment. He pointed out that the objective of the amendment was to merely substitute authentication of the President with the passing of the Appropriation Bill in the House of the People. This would ensure that the Parliament would have control over financial matters.Another member was not too convinced with clause 2. He argued that it was restrictive and limited the \u2018sovereignty of Parliament\u2019. The issue of amendments to the Appropriation Bill could be left for the conventions or rules of the Parliament.

It regulated the President\u2019s special address to the Parliament.A member proposed an amendment that would make the subject of thePresident\u2019s address broader. He argued that the President, being a non-party head of the state should provide \u2018general overview of policy, or the prospects before the country, rather than with the specific causes of the summons\u2019. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that the phrase \u2018causes of its summons\u2019 waswide enough to include any subject matter. Hence it was unnecessary to accept this amendment.Another member was not convinced of the necessity of this Draft Article. He brought in a comparative perspective and noted that England did not make it binding on the King to address the Parliament.

This article regulated the exercise of the President\u2019s power.A member moved an amendment to regulate the selection of Cabinet ministers and restrict the number to 15 ministers. He proposed that the ministers be elected by the houses of the Parliament on the basis of proportional representation. This would prevent a majoritarian government. He invoked the system in Switzerland to illustrate how the election of cabinet ministers would not result in any oppression or revolution. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee disagreed with these proposals. He argued that the Prime Minister must not be constitutionally mandated to have 15 ministers in the Cabinet; he/she might find it practical and efficient to have fewer ministers. On the proposal to elect ministers based on proportional representation, he urged that the Instrument of Instructions for President, that the Drafting Committee would draft, would take care of minority representation in the Cabinet.There was another proposal to delete \u2018with the Prime Minister at the head\u2019. The mover wanted to keep the Prime Minister out of the Constitution. He argued that though the institution of Prime Minister was essential to carry out government business, it should not be mentioned in the Constitution. This would also prevent the power from centralising in the hands of one Minister. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued that the Prime Minister was indispensable to achieve collective responsibility of the Cabinet and to prevent undue influence of the President on the ministers. Further, in England too, the office of Prime Minister which had previously been recognised through convention, gained statutory recognition.A member introduced amendments to allow the President to use his/her discretionary power without the Cabinet's aid. He argued that the Draft Constitution provided with a similar provision for the Governor and the same should be extended to the President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that this proposal relied on the Government of India Act, 1935 which had given the Governor-General power to act according to his discretion. He reminded that under the Indian Constitution the President merely has certain prerogatives and not functions. Therefore, this proposal was unnecessary.The Assembly negatived all the amendments.

However, members wanted certain tweaks.Some argued that the Draft Article did not engage with discrimination based on family and descent. Others wanted a specific mention of gardens, roads and tramways as potential public spaces where people could be discriminated. In response to these points, it was clarified that while the Draft Article specifically mentions some spaces, the general nature of the language used in the Article was sufficient to cover a wide range of public spaces including those that were not specified in the Article\u2019s text. Also, in addition to the clause in the Draft Article which allowed the state to make special provisions for women and children, there was a proposal to add a similar clause for Scheduled Castes and Tribes as well.

It directed the State to adopt certain principles in its dealings with the world at large.An amendment was moved at the beginning of the debate that proposed to include a more succinct version of the Draft Article. A large section of the Assembly emphasised the importance of world peace. Members felt that India should not just play a role in effectuating world peace; oneclaimed that India was best placed to do so: peace, non-aggression and spirituality were key aspects on India history and culture. Anothermember argued that making vague statements was enough; India should, through some formal mechanism, pledge that it will work towards world peace. There was quite a bit of discussion around international law and its role in the world. Members viewed international law as playing a critical role in ensuring amicable relations between nations. A member went further: he hoped that, at some point in the future, a world government would emerge where nations gave up some part of their sovereignty.Members viewed the Draft Article as an expression of India\u2019s intention to pursue an independent foreign policy.

It established the office of the Auditor-General of India and laid out conditions relating to his conditions of service.A number of amendments were proposed by one member of the Drafting Committee. Firstly, he proposed to replace the word \u2018Auditor-General\u2019 with the words \u2018Comptroller and Auditor-General\u2019. He argued that the latter better illustrated the function of the Auditor-General, who not only audited but also had some control over government expenses.The same member of the Drafting Committee also moved two amendments to bring the Auditor-General\u2019s rights and powers in line with the Supreme Court. Firstly, he proposed an amendment to clause (4) which allowed the Auditor-General to make rules relating to the conditions of service for his staff, subject to law made by Parliament and presidential approval in certain cases. Secondly, he proposed that all administrative expenses, including salaries, would be charged to the revenues of India. He contended that these amendments were non-controversial, as they were based on previously accepted principles of parity among civil servants. These amendments received the popular support of the Assembly. However, one member expressed strong opposition to the second amendment, arguing that the practice of charging anything to revenue should be done away with completely.Another member proposed that clause (1) be amended to require that the Auditor-General be appointed by the President \u2018by warrant under his hand and seal\u2019. He contended that this was necessary as similar language was used in Draft Article 103 (Article 124) to describe the appointment of the Chief Justice of India by the President.

It aimed to protect and promote the interest of the workers.The debate began with and centred around an amendment that proposed to add a line thatdirected the State to ensure that rural areas were economically self-sufficient by encouraging the use of swadeshi goods and the promotion of cottage industries. It was argued that there was a stark difference in the economic fortunes of villages/rural areas as compared to cities; The growth of economic opportunity in cities came at the cost of the villages. Indians were abandoningrural India for greener economic pastures in cities. The amendment mover wanted to stop this andfelt that cottage industries could play a critical role in the economic transformation andempowerment of rural areas. Another member chimed inand noted that capitalists should be not be given the lead to facilitate the emergence of cottage industries. The approach that members settled on was to organise these centres of economic activity around cooperative societies.The debate around Article 34 also saw members engaging with larger themes: they believed that economic and social democracy were prerequisites for the success of political democracy.

It defined the scope of the term \u2018State\u2019 \u2013 used extensively in the constitutional text. This Article, as one Assembly member argued, was indispensable to enforce fundamental rights as it identified those authorities upon whom fundamental rights were binding. Members of the Assembly were concerned that the wording of the Article was too vague and some moved amendments. They specifically had trouble with the term \u2018other authorities\u2019 which would in effect bring in almost every government agency or officer under the ambit \u2018State\u2019. One member had a semantic complaint: while it was fine for fundamental rights to be binding on institutions like district boards and municipalities, to refer to these institutions as the \u2018State\u2019 was inappropriate. In the end, it was clarified that \u2018authorities\u2019 would refer those that had \u2018the power to make laws or the power to have discretion vested in it\u2019. Also, in response to members who were opposed to the use of the term \u2018State\u2019, it was argued that it would be cumbersome to list out the various institutions upon whom fundamental rights were binding; so the term \u2018State\u2019 - with its comprehensiveness and economy of words \u2013 was useful to adopt throughout the fundamental rights section and the Constitution.The Assembly adopted the Article with just one amendment: \u2018or under the government of India\u2019 was added to the end of the Article to account for those territories which were not part of India but nonetheless under the control of the Indian government.

It directed the State to engage in social transformation to promote the welfare of Indians. A member wanted to replace the Draft Article with a provision that directed the State to establish a socialist order and take over, among other things, the ownership of important sectors of the economy. It was argued that prevailing capitalist system was oppressive, and the only way to secure the welfare of the people was to organise India on socialist lines and this required \u2018socialist democracy\u2019 to be explicitly mentioned in the constitutional text. Another member, while admitting the importance of the article, was concerned about its implementation. He invoked the \u2018Instrument of Instructions\u2019 of the Government of India Act 1935 \u2013 a set of provisions that were similar to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) in that they were directives to certain constitutional authorities. He argued that the 1935 Act had some provisions to ensure their implementation. The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, had no such provisions; He wanted a \u2018superior authority\u2019 could oversee the implementation and act against the transgression of DPSPs. It was clarified that the Constitution, in addition to establishing political democracy, also aimed to strive for economic democracy. However, there were many ways that economic democracy could be achieved \u2013 socialism, communism \u2013 and the Constitution would not take a stand on which path to adopt.The issue of implementation was not responded to here but was done in a previous debate (See Article 37 debate summary)The Assembly adopted the Draft Article with no amendments.

The amendment added the word \u2018privileges\u2019 which was missing from the initial Draft Article.One member proposed the insertion of the following proviso to clause (2):\u2018 Provided that no law made under this article by Parliament shall provide that the pension allowable to a judge of the Supreme Court under that law shall be less than that which would have been admissible to him if he had been governed by the provisions which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were applicable to the judges of the Federal Court.\u2019He argued that the Draft Article as it stood, allowed Parliament to reduce the salaries and pension of future judges of the Supreme Court. As higher salaries were necessary to attract the brightest legal minds to the bench, he wanted to restrain Parliament from reducing salaries, and thereby their pensions, below the level at which the current judges of the Federal Court were compensated. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that this amendment presumed that the present Federal Court judges would continue to receive the same salary. It was outside the scope of the Drafting Committee to make such a decision, which would instead be left to Parliament; as such, the amendment was premature.The proposed amendment by the member was negatived, while the Assembly accepted the amendment proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.

Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on 3rd June 1949. It conferred appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court for cases emerging from the High Courts that involved crucial questions on the interpretation of the Constitution.A member sought to substitute \u2018State\u2019 in clause 1 with \u2018territory of India\u2019. He argued that \u2018State\u2019 would have a more restrictive scope \u2013 it would leave out provinces which would be acquired and would join India.There was a proposal to omit \u2018as to the interpretation of this Constitution\u2019 from clauses (1) and (3). He pointed out that by qualifying an issue to be a substantive question of law relating to the interpretation of the Constitution, crucial questions and defects relating to other laws would be unchallenged. \u2018Grossest violations\u2019 in the Indian Penal Code, the Evidence Act and other laws could not be appealed to the Supreme Court. Consequentially, the High Courts must be empowered to grant appeal certificate to all cases including issues on substantive questions of law. Since the Supreme Court would be vested with the powers of the erstwhile Privy Council and Federal Courts, there was no need to restrict the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction.A member from the Drafting Committee responded to the above concerns. He clarified the scope of the Draft Article: \u2018irrespective of any value, if a substantial question as to the interpretation of the constitution arises, an appeal lies o the Supreme Court\u2019. So, the Draft Article dealt solely with constitutional questions. With respect to claims relating to other laws/subject matters, subsequent articles covered the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Draft Article 111 and 112 allowed the Court to hear appeals on a variety of issues that would cover any criminal or civil issues. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee reiterated his colleague's arguments. He stressed that the Draft Article concerned jurisdiction regarding only constitutional issues, other issues are covered under Draft Article 111.The Assembly accepted a minor amendment as moved by the Drafting Committee \u2013 other proposals were negatived.

It dealtwith the President\u2019s pardoning power.A member proposedto delete clause 3 of the Draft Article. He argued that as the \u2018Supreme Head of the State\u2019 only the President must have the power to decide on clemency pleas. He invoked American and English examples to demonstrate how pardoning power is usually restricted to the representative of a nation. If the Governor or Ruler of the Indian States also shared this power, it would impinge on India\u2019s federalism and sovereignty. In response, a member argued against the proposal. He noted how the Governor would be best placed to decide on pardoning cases as he/she would be \u2018better informed\u2019. He also pointed out that as an appointee of the Prime Minister, the Governor was responsible to the legislature. This would keep a check on his/her exercise of the pardoning power.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee clarified the general principles of this Draft Article. The pardoning power for offences committed against Federal laws would be with the President and for those committed against Statelaws would be with the Governor. However, with respect to the death penalty, both would have clemency power. The Chairman, responding to the proposal to remove clause 3, pointed out that the Draft Article put in place the existing practice. The Governor on Home Minister\u2019s advice would decide on the pardoning pleas first. Only the rejected pleas would then go to the President.The Assembly adopted the Draft Article without any amendments on 29th December 1948.

He was concerned with the lack of invocation of \u2018grace and blessing of God\u2019 in the Constitution. The Indian religious and spiritual legacy has given special prominence to God: every religion including Hinduism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism invoke God in religious texts and ceremonies. He added that the Constitution was sacred and must be offered to God. In opposition, a member argued that this amendment would \u2018be excluding those people who have no faith in God at all\u2019. He noted that this amendment would create an 'obligation on people that they should have faith in God'.Another member passed a similar amendment. However, in his proposal \u2018agnostics\u2019 were given a choice to not invoke God and just \u2018solemnly affirm\u2019. This amendment, he argued, protected a person\u2019s freedom of faith. Mention of \u2018God\u2019 in the oath does not impinge on the \u2018secularity\u2019 of the Indian State. Further, when a person has taken an oath, they do so in their personal capacity and not as the official head of the State. He also drew on the British and Irish examples to demonstrate how the invocation of God does not lead to communalism.Generally opposing the use of \u2018God\u2019 in the oath, a member argued that it was unnecessary to invoke \u2018God\u2019 who is omnipresent. Instead, he urged that oath must be taken in the name of the people of India, as laid out in the Irish Constitution.There was a proposal to delete the Draft Article. The mover noted that the Constitution was human-made and imperfect, the name of perfect God should not be dragged into the Constitution.A member put forth a case for including promise to not promote one\u2019s interest and family\u2019s aggrandisement.

This article laid down the scope of the executive power of the Union.A member moved an amendment to delete proviso to clause 1. Further, he sought to amend clause 1 to give the Union executive power on only mattersrelating to theUnion List. He argued that this Article impaired the federal structure by centralising the power with the Parliament. Through his amendments, provincial autonomy would be protected and the central government would not be given prominence in matters relating to the Concurrent list. In support, another member noted that while the Parliament has legislative power on matters relating to the Concurrent List, this must not translate into the Union Government having executive power on these matters. Instead, in the interest of efficient and good governance, the State government must be entrusted with this power. Another member came down heavily on this article. He said: \u201cthis clause as it stands is sure to convert the Federation into an entirely unitary form of Government\u201d. He highlighted that \u2018provincial autonomy\u2019 was in practice even during colonial rule and departure from this principle would result in \u2018totalitarianism\u2019.A member of the Drafting Committee opposed these amendments. He suggested that the nature of federalism in India would take shape with time and the Assembly should refrain from adopting a theoretical approach to it. Moreover, the proviso to clause 1 would ensure clear and precise allocation of executive responsibility. Further, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee clarified the general principles of the proviso. First, the power to execute laws made by the Parliament on matters relating to Concurrent List ordinarily rested with the states. Second, only in exceptional circumstances, the Parliament could take on executive authority in these matters. In defence of the proviso, he invoked references to the Australian federal framework. He also noted that this proviso would enable the Central Government to put laws relating to social issues in action. This would ensure implementation of social laws in cases where states were not keen. The amendments did not come through.

It prescribed the duration of each of the Houses of Parliament.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment that sought to replace the words \u2018by the President\u2019 in the proviso, with \u2018by Parliament by law\u2019. He argued that this extraordinary power during Emergency should be with the Parliament and not the President. Other members opposed this amendment as they believed that the President, who is representative of the nation, must be given the power to extend the duration of the Parliament. One member opposed the draft article in its entirety, claiming that regardless of the nature of the emergency, people should have the right to elect new representatives every five years.Another member moved an amendment that sought to maintain the 5-year symmetry of election in the House of People: through this amendment, the mover proposed that the term of the House of People elected after emergency must be only for the remaining period \u2018for which it would have been elected if the dissolution had taken place in the normal course\u2019.The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 18 May 1949 with minor amendments moved by the Drafting Committee.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 51A Fundamental duties..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 51A Fundamental duties.It shall be the duty of every citizen of India\u2014(a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem;(b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;(d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;(e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;(f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;(g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures;(h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;(i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;(j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement;(k) who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.Debate SummaryArticle 51A was not included in the Draft Constitution, 1948.

30 December 1948, 31 December 1948, 14 October 1949 and 17 October 1949. This article sought to govern the office of the Prime Minister and Ministers. Importantly, it established the collective responsibility of the Ministers to the House of People.A member wanted to introduce a new provision to regulate the removal of Ministers. He argued that encoding this would prevent misuse of power by the future legislature on the Ministers. This would ensure non-interference and smooth administration of the responsibilities of the Ministers.There was a proposal to ensure that the Prime Minister would be appointed from a political party with the majority votes in the Parliament. This would enable a stable Ministry that \u2018commands confidence in the House\u2019. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment that would mandate the President to follow the Instrument of Instructions to exercise his/her power. It also barred the scrutiny of decisions taken by the President. A member was against such bar, he argued that this would give rise to an \u2018autocratic President\u2019 as opposed to a \u2018constitutional President\u2019.A member sought to replace \u2018pleasure of the President\u2019 with \u2018confidence of the House of People\u2019. He highlighted that this proposal was not motivated by communalism, instead, it merely codified an existing convention. He argued that as a matter of practice, the Ministers held their position only as long as they commanded the confidence of the House of People. This convention which found its practice in Britain and America needed to be written in the Constitution and not left out for future ambiguities or Supreme Court interpretation.In order to be appointed as a Minister, one member proposed, he/she should have been elected from the House of People. He pointed out that the appointing \u2018permanent Ministers\u2019 from the nominated members of the Parliament would violate democratic principles. Only a member who had the confidence of the electorate must be made a Minister.Only the proposal of the Drafting Committee Chairman was accepted. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 31 December 1948.

It defines the name and territory of India.A member of the Drafting Committee clarified the object of using the term \u2018Union of States\u2019: it was to make it explicit that India was a federation of states. Thefederation was an indestructible unit andnot a result of an agreement between states.Another member proposed to add \u2018Secular, Federal, Socialist\u2019 to \u2018Union of States\u2019. He argued that, as the Preamble of the Constitution was not yet adopted, Draft Article 1 should embody \u2018aspirations\u2019 that the Constitution seeks to achieve. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee opposed this amendment. He notedthat the social and economic policy decisions were tobe taken by elected parliamentarians. To encode the form of society would destroy \u2018democracy altogether\u2019. He further pointed out several Directive Principles of the State Policy including the right to livelihood, redistribution of material resources and equal pay for equal work weresocialistic. There was no need to include \u2018socialist\u2019 in Draft Article 1.Some members suggested alternative names to India. One wanted \u2018Bharat\u2019 or \u2018Hind\u2019 to gain more prominence and to be placed before \u2018India\u2019. Another suggested \u2018Union of Indian Socialistic republics U. I. S.

It enabled each house of the Parliament to make its own rules of procedure.A member proposed that clause (4) of the Draft Article should allow for the Chairman of the Council of States to lead the joint sitting of the Parliament in case of the Speaker's absence. He argued that as the rules of procedure were framed by the President in consultation with the Chairman of the Council of States, the latter would find it difficult and embarrassing to propose his/herown name. Therefore, even though the Chairman was the most appropriate person to preside in the absence of the Speaker, he/shewould be unlikely to do so withoutan explicit provision. Several other members responded that as the Chairman was also the Vice-President of India, the amendment was highly improper as it seemingly put theVice-President below the Speaker.The amendment was subsequently withdrawnand the Assembly adoptedthe Draft Article on10th June 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 365 Effect of failure to comply with, or to give effect to, directions given by the Union..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 365 Effect of failure to comply with, or to give effect to, directions given by the Union.Where any State has failed to comply with, or to give effect to, any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the Union under any of the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 111 Assent to Bills..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 111 Assent to Bills.When a Bill has been passed by the Houses of Parliament, it shall be presented to the President, and the President shall declare either that he assents to the Bill, or that he withholds assent therefrom:   Provided that the President may, as soon as possible after the presentation to him of a Bill for assent, return the Bill if it is not a Money Bill to the Houses with a message requesting that they will reconsider the Bill or any specified provisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his message, and when a Bill is so returned, the Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly, and if the Bill is passed again by the Houses with or without amendment and presented to the President for assent, the President shall not withhold assent therefrom.Debate SummaryArticle 91, Draft Constitution, 1948When a Bill has been passed by the Houses of Parliament, it shall be presented to the President, and the President shall declare either that he assents to the Bill, or that he withholds assent therefrom:Provided that the President may, not later than six weeks after the presentation to him of a Bill for assent, return the Bill if it is not a Money Bill to the Houses with a message requesting that they will reconsider the Bill or any specified provision thereof, and, in particular, will consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his message, and the Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly.Draft Article 91 (Article 111, Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on 20th May 1949. It regulated the President\u2019s assent to Bills.A member moved an amendment that would make it mandatory for the President to assent to a Bill. He argued that the President should not have a right to dissent in legislative business as he/she had a titular role and was \u2018analogous to the King in England\u2019.In the proviso, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee sought to replace \u2018not later than six weeks\u2019 to \u2018as soon as possible\u2019. Another member argued for further amending this phrase to \u2018as soon as may be\u2019 in order to give the President more time to respond to the Bill.After a Bill was sent back to the Parliament for reconsideration, what would happen if the President\u2019s suggestions were not taken into account and the Parliament sent the Bill back to the President? A member moved an amendment to make it compulsory for the President to provide assent if it was sent by the Parliament for the second time. Another memberproposed a very radical suggestion: if the President refused to provide assent, the House of the People would automatically dissolve and fresh elections were to be conducted. If the political party which was in power prior to the dissolution formed the government again, then the President would resign and the Bill would become an Act. In order to rectify this situation the Assembly decided to insert the following in the proviso: \u2018and if the Bill is passed again by the House with or without amendment and presented to the President for assent, the President shall not withhold assent therefrom.\u2019The Assembly did not accept any other proposals and adopted the Draft Article on 20th May 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 301 Freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 301 Freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse.Subject to the other provisions of this Part, trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 282 Expenditure defrayable by the Union or a State out of its revenues..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 282 Expenditure defrayable by the Union or a State out of its revenues.The Union or a State may make any grants for any public purpose, notwithstanding that the purpose is not one with respect to which Parliament or the Legislature of the State, as the case may be, may make laws.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 373 Power of President to make order in respect of persons under preventive detention in certain cases..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 373 Power of President to make order in respect of persons under preventive detention in certain cases.Until provision is made by Parliament under clause (7) of article 22, or until the expiration of one year from the commencement of this Constitution, whichever is earlier, the said article shall have effect as if for any reference to Parliament in clauses (4) and (7) thereof therewere substituted a reference to the President and for any reference to any law made by Parliament in those clauses there were substituted a reference to an order made by the President.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 95 Power of the Deputy Speaker or other person to perform the duties of the office of, or to act as, Speaker..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 95 Power of the Deputy Speaker or other person to perform the duties of the office of, or to act as, Speaker.(1) While the office of Speaker is vacant, the duties of the office shall be performed by the Deputy Speaker or, if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant, by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose.(2) During the absence of the Speaker from any sitting of the House of the People the Deputy Speaker or, if he is also absent, such person as may be determined by the rules of procedure of the House, or, if no such person is present, such other person as may be determined by the House, shall act as Speaker.Debate SummaryArticle 78, Draft Constitution 1948(1) While the office of Speaker is vacant, the duties of the office shall be performed by the Deputy Speaker, or if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant, by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose.(2) During the absence of the Speaker from any sitting of the House of the People, the Deputy Speaker or, if he is also absent, such person as may be determined by the rules of procedure of the House, or, if no such person is present, such other person as may be determined by the House, shall act as Speaker.Draft Article 78 (Article 95, Constitution of India, 1950) was discussed on 19th May 1949.

It laid down the office of Secretariat of Parliament. It was not a part of the original Draft Constitution, 1948. Instead, it was introduced as an amendment by the Drafting Committee.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that the motivation to include this provision stemmed from a Conference organised by Speakers of various Provinces. Encoding this provision in the Constitution would ensure that the office of the Secretariat was not controlled by the Executive, instead, it would be appointed and regulated by the Parliament itself.A member believed that this Draft Article would protect the independence of the office of the Secretariat. He invoked his experiences as a Mayor and highlighted how the Secretariats for the Mayors were under complete control of the Executive. This led to several issues including denial of granting sufficient resources for the functioning of his office. This Draft Article would tackle these problems at the Parliament level.There was an argument made to lay down terms relating to appointment, promotions and conditions of service in this Draft Article itself. The member noted that such matters should not be left for the Parliament to decide. He went a step further and demanded \u2018Federal Public Service Commission\u2019 to be made in charge of the Secretariat, not the Parliament. This would ensure impartiality in appointing and running of the office.The Assembly did not accept these proposals.

It was only 12th September 1948, that language provisions were formally moved in the Assembly by Gopalaswami Ayyangar; these provisions came to be popularly referred to as the \u2018Munshi-Ayyangar formula\u2019 to indicate the authors of the proposal. K.M. Munshi and Ayyangar were tasked by the Assembly to propose language provisions that could be accepted by all warring groups. These provisions were moved together and taken up by the Assembly on 12th, 13th, and 14th September 1949Draft Article 301B was the second Article in the Munshi-Ayyangar proposal. The provision received criticism on two counts from some Hindi-wallah members. They did not want any commission or parliamentary committee to find mention in the Article, as they wanted the functions that the Article gave these two institutions to be handled by a future parliament. It is plausible that the underlying concern here was that the Article called for the Commission to compose of individuals representing different regional languages \u2013 this may put roadblocks on the early replacement of English with Hindi. The second concern was that Draft Article seemed to suggest that for a period of 5 years, till the first Commission was set up, that Hindi was not be considered at all, or only in addition to English for the official purposes of the union.

It authorized the Supreme Court to make rules for its functioning.One member suggested that clause (1) be amended to remove the requirement that court seek the approval of the President before adopting any rules. He argued that the rules pertained to the \u2018internal functioning\u2019 of the court, and hence the requirement amounted to executive interference with the functioning of the judiciary. This received the support of several members in the Assembly; it was noted that the High Court was not required to obtain the consent of the Governor when making similar rules. In response, another member argued that the Draft Article already provided that the rule-making power of the Supreme Court was subject to laws passed by Parliament, and hence the requirement of presidential approval was a \u2018safety valve\u2019 for the judiciary. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that the requirement was analogous to existing provisions under the Government of India Act, 1935. He alsoclarified that the purpose was to ensure that rules did not impose an undue burden on the exchequer.A member of the Drafting Committee proposed the insertion of the following as sub-clause (bb):\u2018rules as to the procedure for the review of any judgment pronounced or order passed by the Court including the time within which applications to the Court for such review are to be entered;\u2019.He stated that this amendment was a necessary corollary to the court\u2019s power to make rules relating to its ability to review its own judgments.Another member of the drafting committee proposed the substitution of Clause (2) as follows:'(2) Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding clause, rules made under this article may fix the minimum number of judges who are to sit for any purpose, and may provide for the powers of single judges and Division Courts.(2a) The minimum number of judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution, or for the purpose of hearing any reference under article 119 of this Constitution shall be five:Provided that where the Court hearing an appeal under article 111 of this Constitution consists of less than five judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal such court shall refer the question to a court constituted under this clause for opinion and shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion.'He argued that the proviso was necessary to ensure that the court\u2019s time was not wasted by forcing a five judge bench to hear a matter for which a three-judge bench was sufficient. This amendment received the support of the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed two amendments: firstly, to mandate the court to only deliver judgments in open court; and secondly, to prevent the court from delivering any judgment without the concurrence of the majority.With the exception of the amendment to remove the requirement of presidential approval, all other amendments were accepted by the Assembly.

It was only 12th September 1948, that language provisions were formally moved in the Assembly by Gopalaswami Ayyangar; these provisions came to be popularly referred to as the \u2018Munshi-Ayyangar formula\u2019 to indicate the authors of the proposal. K.M. Munshi and Ayyangar were tasked by the Assembly to propose language provisions that could be accepted by all warring groups. These provisions were moved together and taken up by the Assembly on 12th, 13th, and 14th September 1949. Draft Article 301-A was the first Article in the proposal. Among other things, it declared Hindi in the Devanagari script as the official language of the union and the use of the international form of Indian numerals for official purposes.The members who had always been against Hindi reluctantly accepted the Article but pointed out that no language could be imposed on India just because it was part of the Constitution. There were others who still persevered to dislodge Hindi \u2013 an amendment was moved to replace it with Hindustani.The adoption of Hindi as the official language in the Draft Article was a huge concession to the \u2018Hindi-wallahs\u2019 in the Assembly. However, they were still not happy with the provision, they criticised it, strategized outside Assembly, and moved amendments.First, they felt that if the Devanagari script was adopted, then why not the Devanagari system of numerals? Second, they were concerned that the Article gave too much time for the replacement of English with Hindi \u2013 they wanted the replacementto happen much sooner. Finally, after a lot of backroom jostling, the Hindi-wallahs put forward a bunch of amendments. The Assembly adopted one of theseamendments: Parliament could, in addition to English, legislate on Nagari numerals as well. This effectively allowedparliament to sanction the use of Devanagari numerals even before the 15 year period. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article with the amendment.

He argued that the Council of States, also known as Second Chambers, was not of any use and an outdated institution. A member of the Drafting Committee argued against this motion. He highlighted that the Council of States would provide another platform for people to take part in politics. Moreover, it would prevent \u2018hasty legislation\u2019 making.There was another proposal to substitute \u2018the Parliament\u2019 with \u2018the Indian National Congress\u2019.

He termed this an \u2018unnecessary imitation of the British system\u2019. He noted that the President is merely an ornamental head of the nation and should not be an integral part of the legislature.

It established the composition of the House of the People.A member proposed to replace single-member constituency, with a \u2018system of proportional representation with multi-member constituencies by means of cumulative vote\u2019. He argued that the former perpetuated a democracy of majority which was \u2018tyrannical\u2019. The system of proportional representation would ensure that voices from diverse sectors were heard. Moreover, the single-member constituencysystem would not guarantee protection to minority communities. He relied on the Irish experience to demonstrate how religious minorities were disenfranchised by the majority. Another member supported this move and believed that proportional representation would ensure \u2018greater reflection of popular will\u2019. Asimilar amendment wasmoved to encode proportional representation. The mover called \u2018Parliamentary democratic system\u2019 a defect in electoral democracy.However, the members of the Drafting Committee were not convinced by this proposal. A member cited practical reasons to oppose this: India\u2019s population was too excessive to conduct elections through proportional representation. And the literacy rate was far too low for this system to succeed. The Chairman relied on the English example: the British categorically dismissed proportional representation as it would adversely impact the stability of governments. Instead, minority representation could be promised through the reservation in the legislature.A member sought to introduce \u2018illiteracy\u2019 a ground for disqualification to vote for the first ten years of the Constitution being in force. He argued that this could drive \u2018adult education\u2019 and would increase the literacy rate.The aforementioned proposal fell through.

It barred the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Council of State from presiding sittings dealing with any resolution seeking their removal.A member believed that the Draft Article failed to address a lacuna: while it prohibited the Chairman and Deputy Chairman from presiding a sitting that dealt with their removal, it did not provide for an alternative member to chair such sittings.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee justified the Draft Article. If the Chairman of the Council of States was facing removal charges then the Deputy Chairman would preside and vice versa.

This Draft Article, gateway clause of Part IV of the Constitution, put forward the institutional division of labour regarding the enforcement of the Directive Principles of State Policy. It explicitly states that the implementation of the principles would be the sole domain of the State, and not the Courts. An amendment was moved in the Assembly to give legal force to the DPSPs. It was felt that without any legal force, the principles were merely pious wishes. A member said that to have critical socio-economic principles, or any provision for that matter, as not legally enforceable would give make the judiciary lax in implementing the Constitution. Further, it was argued that the socio-economic principles had been ignored during colonial rule, and it was imperative to give them effect in independent India, and legal enforceability was critical to this endeavour, The Article did find support. Another member felt that the very existence of the DPSPs in the constitutional text meant that legislatures could not ignore or violate them, and was confident that the principles would be implemented despite the lack of legal force behind them.

Operating under this false understanding, a member argued that religious property should be treated on par with other types of property and should be taxable. A member intervened and clarified the true meaning of the Article and the motivations behind it. It was pointed out that in Indian history kings often collected a special tax to support a particular religion; this use of public tax money had no place in secular India. The Article was adopted without amendment.

The Chairman of the Drafting Committee stated that the provision was necessary to ensure that the Supreme Court could exercise jurisdiction over all proceedings, including those relating to income tax and property acquisition.One member proposed that the article be amended to expand the power of the court to anything under jurisdiction by law \u2018or practice\u2019.

The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that the term was ordinarily taken to include matters of procedure, it would be improper to make the amendment since Draft Article 112B dealt only with the substantive matter of jurisdiction.Another member proposed that the Supreme Court's jurisdiction should be extended to allow it to hear appeals against death sentences passed by court martials, citingcertain procedural issues which impacted the ability of the accused to have a fair and impartial trial.

As the text of the Draft Article suggests, it directed the State to bring about a uniform civil code across India. The debate around the Draft Article triggered conflict. Most of the opposition to the Draft Article came from Muslim members who moved amendments to keep personal laws out of Draft Article\u2019 scope and introduce a proviso that operationalised the Draft Article only with the prior assent of the community.The arguments mobilised to attack the Draft Article included: first, that uniform civil code violated freedom of religion; second, the Draft Article would create disharmony within the Muslim community and third; it was wrong to interfere with personal law without the approval of religious communities. The Draft Article did find support. Members argued that the UCC was important to uphold the unity of the country and the Constitution\u2019s secular credentials.

It was further added that women\u2019s rights could never be secured without a UCC. Also, the argument that UCC would violate religious freedom under the Constitution was rejected - the Constitution gave space for social reform legislation.At the end of the debate, it was clarified that there was nothing new about the UCC: there was already a common civil code in India. The only difference with the new UCC was that it would cover marriage and inheritance \u2013 which were not under the scope of the existing code.

The Draft Article laiddown conditions for the President\u2019s office including emoluments and benefits.There was a proposal to ensure that if the President-elect was a ruler from aPrincely statehe/she would be required to give away his/her privy purse based pension/allowance. This would be consistent with the democratic and republican ideals of the Constitution. The Chair of the Drafting Committee suggested that this issue was better dealt with later when the Princely states accede to the Indian union.A member wanted to delete \u2018the President shall have an official residence\u2019 from clause 3.

The Drafting Committee was merely encoding an already existing precedent.Another member moved an amendment to add retirement benefits in the Draft Article. He argued that this provision was novel and even the American Constitution missed includingsuch a provision. A host of officers including the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition and judges of the higher judiciary enjoy pension post-retirement. It was important to extend this benefit to the former sovereign head of the nation. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee found this impractical. He noted that if a person were to be re-elected as a President, according to the proposal, he/she would be entitled to a pension for his/her previous term as President in addition to a salary for his/her current term and salary.

It laid down the term of the Vice-President\u2019s office.There was a proposal to specify the emoluments including a salary of INR 4500 per month, residential and post-retirement benefits. The mover argued that if the President\u2019s residential benefits were laid down in the Constitution, similar provisions must be made for the Vice-President. Further, the post-retirement benefits would ensure that candidates from economically underprivileged backgrounds were provided with equal opportunity to compete in the Vice-Presidential elections.A member wanted to include grounds of disqualifications including violation of the Constitution, a conviction of a crime, mental incapacity and corruption. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded by highlighting that \u2018want of confidence\u2019 in clause b covers the grounds mentioned in the member\u2019s amendment- there was no need to specifically mention it in the Constitution.Another member sought clarity with respect to removal of the Vice-President. The Draft Article did not specify the required majority to remove the Vice-President. Further, the member was puzzled with the removal process of the Vice-President being more stringent than that of the President. Vice-President\u2019s removal required the Resolution to be passed by both houses of the Parliament but that of President\u2019s required only one. A member moved an amendment which would require 2/3rd majority from both the houses of the Parliament to remove the Vice-President. He stressed that since the Vice-President\u2019s role is important, his removal must not be a casual affair. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that the Vice-President\u2019s primary role is that as the Chairman of the Council of States.

The other forms of income or public revenue would, therefore, be excluded.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that the Committee would reconsider this provision and present it at a later stage.

He noted that the Consolidated Fund was just another term for Public Account (revenues) of the Central Government. Citing references to the Constitutions of Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, he argued that Consolidated Fund was a necessity \u2013 it would prevent \u2018proceeds of taxes being frittered away by laws made by Parliament in individual purposes without regard to the general necessity of the people at all.\u2019A member wasapprehensive aboutthe change in nomenclature.

This would constitutionally recognise the Leader of Opposition and promote \u2018parliamentary opposition\u2019 which is a bulwark of democracy. Moreover, as parliamentary democracy conditions must not be created to promote only one-party government.

It defined the Supreme Court\u2019s powers to grant special leave to appeal.One member proposed deleting the language which restricted the Supreme Court from hearing any case on appeal from a court or tribunal of the Unions of States. He argued that since the Instruments of Accession gave the Central government the power to govern all matters except taxation, this created a pointless distinction between the princely states and the provinces. He also contended that it was improper to apply such jurisdictional limitations on the Supreme Court. This amendment was positively received by the Assembly, with several members making arguments in favour of an explicit expansion of the court\u2019s powers. One member argued that the court should be able to determine cases using 'the principles of jurisprudence and considerations of natural justice\u201d. Another believed that the Draft Article should specifically be expanded to extend to 'civil, criminal, or revenue'matters. A member of the Drafting Committee clarified that the Supreme Court was free to develop its own rules when exercising its jurisdictions, and that there was nothing to prevent it from interfering even in criminal cases.The proposed amendment was accepted by the Assembly, and Draft Article 112 was initially adopted on 6th June 1949.Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee proposed to wholly replace the adopted Draft Article with the following:\u2018112.(1) The Supreme court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgement, decree, determination sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any Court or tribunal in the territory of India.(2) Nothing in clause (1) of this article shall apply to any judgement, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any court of tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.'The addition of clause (2) was made at the behest of the Defence Ministry, who cited the examples of countries such as the UK following a similar practice of excluding decisions of court-martials from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. This amendment received strong opposition in the Assembly. One member argued that persons convicted to death in military tribunals should have the right of appeal because the procedures followed in such tribunals was \u2018against all laws of jurisprudence\u2019. Another contended that the civilians who committed offences under the jurisdiction of these tribunals would be unfairly deprived of their right to appeal. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee, who had earlier taken a different stance on this matter, stated that he had been convinced by the Defence Ministry that this clause was necessary to maintain discipline in the army. He also clarified that the Supreme Court was not fully stripped of its power with regard to the armed forces, as it could still examine whether a specific court martial exceeded its jurisdiction, or whether proceedings were completely arbitrary.The amendment was accepted by the Assembly, and the amended Draft Article was adopted on 16th October 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 34 Restriction on rights conferred by this Part while martial law is in force in any area..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 34 Restriction on rights conferred by this Part while martial law is in force in any area.Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part, Parliament may by law indemnify any person in the service of the Union or of a State or any other person in respect of any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order in any area within the territory of India where martial law was in force or validate any sentence passed, punishment inflicted, forfeiture ordered or other act done under martial law in such area.Debate SummaryArticle 34 of the Constitution was one of the few provisions that were not part of the Draft Constitution 1948. It was introduced and debated in the Assembly towards the end of the constitution-making process on 14 and 16 November 1949. The Article restricted fundamental rights during the operation of martial law by giving officers of the state certain powers.Two substantive amendments were moved to oppose the Article. The first wanted the delete the Draft Article as it wasan open invitation to officers of the state to indulge in excesses during martial law. The second wanted to remove \u2018any person\u2019 from the text arguing that there was no need to extend the immunity provided the Article to individuals who were not officers of the state. Both amendments were countered. First, it was explained that a military officer, to successfully engage with a situation of \u2018insurrection or rebellion or the overthrow of the state\u2019, required the ability to pass orders and prescribe procedures for cases where his/her orders were violated. These powers were barred by Article 20 and 21, as the military officer was not a law-making person and the procedure that he/she prescribes would not come under \u2018procedures accordingly to law\u2019. The Draft Article, therefore, was indispensable for the military or any officerof the state to discharge his/her duties effectively during martial law. Further, it was clarified that is some cases, the onus might shift on a civilian who might not be an officer of the stateto act in waysto deal with a martial law situation. In these cases, the civilian\u2019s actions must come under the ambit of the Draft Article.At the end of the debate, the Assembly adopted Article 34 with no amendment.

The Draft Article set out the procedure by which the President of India could be removed from office. Clause 1 stated that impeachment proceedings could be initiated in either house of parliament. An amendment was moved to give this power to only the lower house, the Lok Sabha. The amendment\u2019s mover argued that unlike the Upper house, Rajya Sabha, whose members were indirectly elected or nominated, the Lok Sabha was truly representative of the people; And this was important to consider in deciding the impeachment process. Another member wanted the Chief Justice of Supreme Court to preside over the investigations into the charges framed against the President, similar to what was provided for in the American Constitution. To ensure impartiality, the member argued, it was more appropriate for the Chief Justice to preside over the House\u2019s proceedings, rather than the Speaker or Deputy Speaker. Further, the investigations would involve questions of fact, admissibility of evidence and other legal aspects which were best handled by a member of the judiciary, like the Chief justice. There was also a proposal to replace the two-thirds majority required to pass an impeachment resolution with just a simple majority. The member who put forward this amendment felt that the two-thirds majority was against the spirit of democracy, was too stringent a criterion, and would make it hard to pass impeachment resolutions. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded to all of the above amendments. On the first amendment, he argued that behaviour of the President is a matter of concern for lower and upper houses, and therefore it did not make sense to only allow the lower house to initiate impeachment proceedings. Second, he said that there was no problem in bringing in the Chief Justice to preside over investigations; This could be provided for in the Houses\u2019 rules of procedure and was not necessary to include in the Constitution. On the third amendment, he argued that unlike a no-confidence motion, an impeachment motion would associate the President with shame, moral turpitude and ruination of the public career of the President. Therefore, it was necessary to set the high bar of a two-thirds majority to pass an impeachment motion. The Draft Article was adopted with a minor amendment.

It conferred privileges and immunities to the Parliament and its members.A member moved an amendment to insert \u2018or any committee thereof\u2019 in clause 4. He argued that the immunity under this Draft Article should not only be conferred to the members of the Parliament, but also non-members who might be a part of any committee set up by the Parliament. He anticipated that the committees would call upon experts and other professions for their testimonies and such persons must have the same parliamentary privileges. This amendment was adopted.Another member proposed to add a new clause which would make the Parliament the final judge on any issue relating to the privilege and such orders passed would be enforceable by the officers of the Parliament. The Assembly rejected this proposal.A member was concerned with the effect of this Draft Article on the freedom of the press. He noted that any such speech or proceedings which the Parliament could publish, the press must an analogous right. The Draft Article\u2019s disregard to the freedom of the press was a lacuna that needed to be addressed. He further objected to clause (3) which noted that the members of the Parliament enjoyed privileges of the members of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. He noted that the privileges of the members of the House of Commons were not codified in a statute. Instead was a matter of precedents that could be understood through common law textbooks. This would put a heavy burden on the Indian parliamentarians, as they would have to hire or seek help from the English lawyers to better understand their privileges. A member of the Drafting Committee noted that the members of the House of Commons enjoyed the \u2018widest privileges\u2019. If the Constitution had to merely encode the existing privileges of the Provincial Legislatures, that would be restrictive: the right to punish a person for contempt of the Parliament would be absent.

It laid down circumstances under which a member\u2019s seat would be considered vacant.Clause 2 of Article 101, Constitution of India 1950 was not a part of the original Draft Article. It was inserted through an amendment moved by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.A member sought to add recollection of a member of the Parliament by electors as a ground for a vacation of his/her seat. He invoked the Swiss and American examples to illustrate how several democratic countries provide for the right to recall a member of the Parliament if he/she fails to \u2018discharge their duties to the constituency\u2019. He argued that under \u2018ideal conditions of democracy\u2019, the right to recall must find a place. One member was not convinced by this proposal. He argued that the amendment did not spell out practical aspects of the recall process. Moreover, it wouldcause practical hurdles.Another member wanted to make it a mandatory for a member to be able to read and write the National Language to be elected to the Parliament.

In case of vacancy of the President\u2019s office, this article gave the Vice-President the President\u2019s powers and obligations until the vacancy was filled.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to ensure that the Vice-President upon assuming the President\u2019s office was entitled to 'privileges, emoluments, and allowances'as decided by the Parliament. A member argued that the benefits that a Vice-President assuming President\u2019s office enjoyed must be the same as that of the President\u2019s. There was no need to discriminate the temporary President. There was a proposal to include 'duties and liabilities' to the Chairman\u2019s amendment. It was argued that, while the amendment took care of the temporary President\u2019s benefits, it did not include \u2018duties and liabilities\u2019 of the President. This would make it hard to impeach the temporary President if he/she violated the Constitution.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded to these concerns. First, he noted that the Parliament should be given the prerogative to fix deferential benefits as this was a temporary position for a short time. He clarified that if there was no separate provision covering the temporary President\u2019s benefits, he/she would be entitled to the President\u2019s benefits. Second, he asserted that the temporary President would have the same obligations as that of the President. The impeachment provisions of the President would apply to the temporary President as well.

It directed the State to protect and promote the economic welfare of citizens with special emphasis on the weaker sections of society.The debate was dominated by the Assembly\u2019s socialists who felt that the Draft Article\u2019s clauses did not do enough to encode socialism in the Constitution. They pointed out that the language of clause allowedprivate interests to obtain the \u2018ownership and control of material resources\u2019 which was antagonistic to the economic welfare of citizens. These members moved amendments that aimed to give specificity to the clauses; they specified what came under \u2018material resources\u2019, and explicitly stated that only the State acting on behalf of the people could have control over material resources.Another member was worried about clause 3 that directed the State to prevent the concentration of wealth and moved an amendment. It was argued that unless the Assembly had plans to install a communist state, the concentration of wealth and inequities would be inevitable. Therefore, the problem was not really the concentration of wealth, but the undueconcentration of wealth.At the end of the debate, it was clarified that the clauses of the Draft Article were deliberatelyworded in a general and extensive manner; the economic system that the socialists were arguing for was compatible with the Draft Article. Therefore there was no need for the relevant amendments. The Assembly had made it clear during the debates on Draft Article 1 that it did not want to prescribe an economic model for India, and instead wished to allow the people of India to choose their favoured model through Parliament..

They wanted to reiterate that Part II was a temporary law on citizenship \u2013 future parliament was to enact an elaborate code.While there were no substantive discussions around this Article, one member moved a motion to delete this article as he believed that it was unnecessary and redundant: Article 11 (Draft Article 6) would suffice.The Assembly adopted this article without any amendments on 12 August 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 28 Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 28 Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions.(1) No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds.(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution.(3) No person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person or, if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto.Debate SummaryArticle 22, Draft Constitution of India, 1948(1) No religious instruction shall be provided by the State in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds:Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution.(2) No person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person, or if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto.(3) Nothing in this article shall prevent any community or denomination from providing religious instruction for pupils of that community or denomination in an educational institution outside its working hours.Draft Article 22 was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 7th December 1948. It aimed to regulate and place restrictions on religious instruction in educational institutions funded by the State. The debate on the Draft Article was comprehensive and contained multiple strands. One member pointed out the text of the Draft Article as it stood allowed non-state institutions to provide religious instruction. As this was not in-line with the underlying motivation behind the Draft Article \u2013 to not allow any state-funded institution to provide religious instruction \u2013 the Assembly acknowledged the flaw, and accepted an amendment to delete \u2018by the state\u2019. It was proposed that subclause 3 be deleted as, it was inconsistent with clause 1, would facilitate conflict between denominations of the same religion, and was redundant in light of clause 2. This amendment too was accepted. There was a discussion about the fate of fully state-funded institutions like Sanskrit College which provided instruction in religious texts that included the Vedas. Would these not be allowed to continue? It was clarified that there was a distinction between research and study of religion, and religious dogma. The Draft Article pertained to the former and not the later.

It granted the Ministers and the Attorney-General of India the rights to speak and take part in the Parliament.A member moved an amendment to restrict rights under this provision only to the elected members of the Parliament. He argued that according to the principle of ministerial responsibility, only elected members must be made ministers. And elected parliamentarians inherently have the right to take part in the parliamentary proceedings. He further added that the rights of participation should be linked with the right to vote.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee opposed this amendment.

He argued that the President should be kept out of a \u2018purely internal concern of the House\u2019. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued against this amendment. A candidate after winning an election did not automatically become a member of the Parliament. He/she must meet additional qualifications including taking the oath.

It laid down the procedures related to the election of the President of India.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out the in order to achieve \u2018uniformity in the scale of representation of the different States\u2019, the Draft Article adopted the proportional representation through single transferable vote approach. He noted that if each member of the electoral college was given one vote, that would not be truly representative.There was opposition to the proportional system that the Draft Article put forth. A member moved an amendment to remove the mention of proportional representation in the Draft Article. She believed that proportional representation was generally used in contexts where there was a 'multiple-member constituency' - something that was not the case for Presidential elections. Anothermember noted that proportional representation system with a single transferable vote, was historically used for elections with more than one seat - it would not be practical to adopt this system for the election of a President.In response to the general objections to the proportional representationsystem, the Chairman of the Assembly argued that there were no better alternatives. Elections through direct majority would not take into account the voices of the minority communities and parties and separate electorates was a system that the Constitution had rejected. The \u2018proportional representation\u2019 system wasthe only guarantee against majority dominance.The Constituent Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 13 December 1948 with minor amendments.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 115 Supplementary, additional or excess grants..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 115 Supplementary, additional or excess grants.(1) The President shall \u2014(a) if the amount authorised by any law made in accordance with the provisions of article 114 to be expended for a particular service for the current financial year is found to be insufficient for the purposes of that year or when a need has arisen during the current financial year for supplementary or additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual financial statement for that year, or(b) if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year in excess of the amount granted for that service and for that year,cause to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament another statement showing the estimated amount of that expenditure or cause to be presented to the House of the People a demand for such excess, as the case may be.(2) The provisions of articles 112, 113 and 114 shall have effect in relation to any such statement and expenditure or demand and also to any law to be made authorising the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or the grant in respect of such demand as they have effect in relation to the annual financial statement and the expenditure mentioned therein or to a demand for a grant and the law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or grant.Debate SummaryArticle 95, Draft Constitution, 1948If in respect of any financial year further expenditure from the revenues of India becomes necessary over and above the expenditure theretofore authorised for that year, the President shall cause to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament a supplementary statement showing the estimated amount of that expenditure, and the provisions of the preceding articles shall have effect in relation to that statement and that expenditure as they have effect in relation to the annual financial statement and the expenditure mentioned therein.Draft Article 95 (Article 115) was debated on 10th June 1949. It laid out the procedure to obtain additional, supplementary, or excess grants which were not included in the annual financial statement.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article with the following:'Supplementary, additional or excess grants.'95. (1) The President shall-(a) if the amount authorised by any law made in accordance with the provisions of article 94 of this Constitution to be expended for a particular service for the current financial year is found to be insufficient for the purposes of that year or when a need has arisen during the current financial year for supplementary or additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual statement for that year; or(b) if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year in excess of the amount granted for that service and for that year,cause to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament another statement showing the estimated amount of that expenditure or cause to be presented to the House of the People a demand for such excess, as the case may be.(2) The provisions of the last three preceding articles shall have effect in relation to any such statement and expenditure or demand and also to any law to be made authorising the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or the grant in respect of such demand as they have effect in relation to the annual financial statement and the expenditure mentioned therein or to a demand for a grant and the law to be made for the authorization of Appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or grant.'The debates in the Assembly were based on this Amendment.The amendment permitted the appropriation of funds for supplementary, additional, and excess grants from the Consolidated Fund of India.One member was not convinced by this Amendment, as he believed that such grants could be misused by the Executive. He instead proposed that supplementary, additional, or excess funds could only be granted by approval of both the Houses of the Parliament. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee defended this amendment: such grants were necessary for the smooth functioning of the Executive, especially during emergency circumstances.Another member argued that this Amendment was inconsistent with Draft Article 94(3) (Article 114), which stated that no money could be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made by law. Therefore, the withdrawal of any money from the fund under Draft Article 95 would violate both the Constitution and the relevant Appropriation Acts. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that Draft Article 95 authorized the President to present estimates of expenditure before the Parliament where necessary, in situations other than those envisaged by Draft Article 94. He further proposed the creation of a Contingency Fund out of the Consolidated Fund of India. The Contingency Fund could be accessed by the executive in an emergency without having to violate the Appropriation Act.The Assembly accepted the Drafting Committee\u2019s Amendment and adopted the Draft Article on 10th June 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 243 W Eleventh Schedule .txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 312 All-India services.txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 312 All-India services(1) Notwithstanding anything in Chapter VI of Part VI or Part XI, if the Council of States has declared by resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest so to do, Parliament may by law provide for the creation of one or more all India services (including an all-India judicial service)common to the Union and the States, and, subject to the other provisions of this Chapter, regulate the recruitment, and the conditions of service of persons appointed, to any such service.(2) The services known at the commencement of this Constitution as the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service shall be deemed to be services created by Parliament under this article.(3) The all-India judicial service referred to in clause (1) shall not include any post inferior to that of a district judge as defined in article 236.(4) The law providing for the creation of the all-India judicial service aforesaid may contain such provisions for the amendment of Chapter VI of Part VIas may be necessary for giving effect to the provisions of that law and no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of article 368.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Part C Provisions As To The Speaker And The Deputy Speaker Of The House Of The People And The Chairman And The Deputy Chairman Of The Council Of States And The Speaker And The Deputy Speaker Of The Legisl....txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Part C Provisions As To The Speaker And The Deputy Speaker Of The House Of The People And The Chairman And The Deputy Chairman Of The Council Of States And The Speaker And The Deputy Speaker Of The Legisl...7.

There was a wide agreement in the Assembly on the importance of the Draft Article. The two main issues around which conflict seem to emerge revolved around the question of residence and the meaning of \u2018backward class\u2019. While some members wanted a residence criterion for employment in a state government, others didn\u2019t want any such restrictions. Arguments in favour of the residence criteria claimed that only natives of a particular state could efficiently discharge their duties as officers of the state government. Also, there seemed to be a concern about people from other states capturing government posts, harming the chances of domiciled or native government job aspirants. The responses to these arguments invoked the idea of common citizenship in the constitution which would be undermined by the residence criteria. The Assembly also discussed the use of the term \u2018backward class\u2019 in the Draft Article. While some preferred the term due to its generality and ability to encompass a wider range of communities, others argued that the generality of term introduced a sense of vagueness; specific terms like \u2018Scheduled Caste\u2019 were better. The Assembly also discussed if it was desirable to have reservations in government jobs for only a fixed period of time.The Constituent Assembly then adopted the Draft Article with some amendments.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 243S Constitution and composition of Wards Committees, etc..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 243S Constitution and composition of Wards Committees, etc.(1) There shall be constituted Wards Committees, consisting of one or more wards, within the territorial area of a Municipality having a population of three lakhs or more.(2) The Legislature of a State may, by law, make provision with respect to \u2014(a) the composition and the territorial area of a Wards Committee;(b) the manner in which the seats in a Wards Committee shall be filled.(3) A member of a Municipality representing a ward within the territorial area of the Wards Committee shall be a member of that Committee.(4) Where a Wards Committee consists of \u2014(a) one ward, the member representing that ward in the Municipality; or(b) two or more wards, one of the members representing such wards in the Municipality elected by the members of the Wards Committee, shall be the Chairperson of that Committee.(5) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the Legislature of a State from making any provision for the constitution of Committees in addition to the Wards Committees.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 234 Recruitment of persons other than district judges to the judicial service..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 234 Recruitment of persons other than district judges to the judicial service.Appointments of persons other than district judges to the judicial service of a State shall be made by the Governor of the State in accordance with rules made by him in that behalf after consultation with the State Public Service Commission and with the High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to such State.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 47 Duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health.txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 47 Duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public healthThe State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.Debate SummaryArticle 38, Draft Constitution, 1948The State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties.Draft Article 38 (Article 47) was debated on 23rd and 24th November, 1948. It imposed an obligation on the state to improve public health, nutrition, and the standard of living.A member moved to expand the scope of the Draft Article by inserting thesentence: 'and shall endeavour to bring about the prohibition of the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs which are injurious to health'.Another member agreed with the spirit of the amendment, but proposedthat the words'except for medicinal purposes' be included in the Draft Article.The debates in the Assembly were based on these two amendments.One member in favour of the amendment argued that it made economic sense, as the loss of revenue caused by the 'increase of crime, disease and the loss of efficiency'was three times higher than the loss of revenue earned from the sale of alcohol. Anothercontended that working class and Dalit families would benefit the most from a ban, as these communities spent a substantial amount of their wages on liquor.However, one member offeredseveral arguments against the adoption of the two amendments. He argued that similar prohibitions in both America and Madras had proven unsuccessful and expensive: many people continued to consume alcohol, while the state incurred extra costs to incarcerate those who broke the ban. Moreover, he contended that prohibition infringed on the personal liberty of citizens. A member from the Adivasi community argued that a ban on alcohol could be used to infringe the religious rights of Adivasis, citing the religious significance attached to the consumption of rice beer.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded to these arguments by reminding the Assembly that the article was a part of the non-justiciable Directive Principles of State Policy, and as such were not legally binding. With regard to the objection raised by the member from the Adivasi community, he noted that the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution guaranteed that no law could be enforced in tribal areas without consulting with District and Regional Tribal Boards.The Assemblyacceptedboth amendments.

The Draft Article lays down the required qualifications for an individual to be elected as the President of India.A member wanted to ensure that aMinister who wanted to run for the President's office first resigned from his current ministerial office.This, he reasoned, would avoid the misuse of the Minister\u2019s office and staff for Presidential campaign. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee highlighted that this amendment would \u2018create complete administrative chaos\u2019. If Ministers were to resign, then alladministrative responsibilities would come to a halt. It would not be feasible to delegate this role to bureaucrats or temporary Ministers. He further noted that the Election Commission, a constitutional body, would ensure fair elections and prevent anyMinister from exercising undue influence.There was an amendment which required President-elect to declare all \u2018right, title, share, property and interest\u2019 in any government-aided or supported enterprise, business or trade. Such assets were to be bought by the government. The amendment moverinvokedGermanPresident Hindenberg\u2019s involvement with the Prussian landlords which strengthened the Nazi government and strongly urged \u2018that President should be free from any entanglements\u2019. Some members opposed thisproposal andarguedthat itwould infringe the right to hold private property which was a recognised fundamental right. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee observed that the proposal was rather novel andunprecedented: he illustrated how even the American Constitution, which adopted a Presidential form of government, did not have a similar provision. Moreover, this amendment was unnecessary as the Indian Constitution viewed the position of the President as \u2018a nominal figurehead\u2019. If the Assembly were to adopt this, there would be a dearth of Presidential candidates.All substantive amendments were rejected.On 27 December 1948, the Draft Article was adopted with a minor amendment.

This Draft Article had two versions, one which laid out the procedure for election of the Governor, and the other which laid out the procedure for appointment.cThe debates focused on whether the Governor should be chosen through election or by appointment.Some members who were in favour of election pointed out that the Assembly had taken a resolution two years ago stating that the Governor would be chosen through election. One member argued that an appointed Governor could be from any state, and therefore would be an inefficient administrator since he would not have any knowledge of the people or language.Many members favoured the system of appointment, but disapproved of the process laid out in the Draft Article. One member argued that provincial autonomy and successful state cabinet governments could only be ensured by the \u2018existence of a fairly impartial constitutional head\u2019. He also opposed the system of appointment from a panel of candidates in the Draft Article as not \u2018conducive to amicable relations\u2019 since it would encourage factionalism within the party. A member of the Drafting Committee also agreed with this proposition, stating that appointment was more suitable given that the function of the Governor was \u2018to be a constitutional head, a sagacious counselor and adviser to the Ministry one who can throw oil over troubled waters\u2019. The Prime Minister agreed with these arguments, stating that appointment would ensure that the Governor was detached from state politics and able to operate fairly and impartially.

The amendment, he contended, simplified the procedure, and gave the President unfettered right to appoint a Governor.

The Assembly discussed this Draft Article on 10thAugust 1949,11thAugust 1949and12thAugust 1949.The debates around this draft article concerned with proposals to include citizenship based on religion and dual citizenship.Some sought to include a residuary provision for citizenship based on religion. They argued that every Hindu or Sikh who is not a citizen of any other state, irrespective of their residence should be entitled for Indian citizenship. In rebuttal, one member strongly urged against hyphenating religion and citizenship. He argued that rules must be informed by justice and equity and not on extraneous conditions.Another member was keen on the draft article accommodating for dual citizenship. He added that this privilege must be extended to countries on the principle of reciprocity.One member, believed that this Draft Article made Indian citizenship cheap.

It aimed at securing and protecting the cultural and educational rights of minorities. During the course of the discussions, the Constituent Assembly decided to split this Draft Article into 2: clauses 1 and 2 remained Article 23, and clause 3 became Draft Article 23A. In this summary, we deal with only Article 23 proper. It was proposed that after \u2018conserve\u2019 the word \u2018develop\u2019 be added. The rationale behindthis was that culture was not static, it was dynamic and progressive \u2013 and the draft article had to reflect this. Another member argued that the Article should confine the scope of minorities to only linguistic ones; the recognition of religion and community-based minorities could promote communalism. It seems like the Assembly did not want to limit minorities to just linguistic minorities; it accepted a proposal to specify the types of minorities in the clause 2 \u2013 that included religion, race, caste and language. It was also argued that the Article should be read as applying to those sections of the population who find themselves as a linguistic minority in a particular state.

Most members agreed with the requirement of High Court certification, with one member stating that Draft Article 112 (Article 136) \u2018committed us to the acceptance of the principle that appeals must lie also on a certificate by the High Court concerned in criminal cases\u2019. Other members disagreed with the latter provision, arguing that it left the judiciary vulnerable to parliamentary interference.Another member proposed that appeals should also lie where an acquittal by a Sessions Court has been overturned by a High Court, and in any case involving \u2018an important question of law\u2019. Some members supported this proposition; they referred to the situations in which social discrimination had resulted in a guilty verdict, and argued that if appeals were not permitted in that situation, innocent men would be hanged.After hearing these arguments, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article as follows:\u2018111-A. The Supreme Court shall have power to entertain and hear appeals from any judgment, final Appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court with regard to criminal matters order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India-(a) if the High Court has on appeal reversed the order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death; or(b) if the High Court has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused person and sentenced him to death; or(c) if the High Court certifies that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court :Provided that an appeal under sub-clause (c) of this clause shall lie subject to such rules as may from time to time be made by the Supreme Court and to such conditions as the High Court may establish or require.(2) Parliament may by law confer on the Supreme Court any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgment, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India subject to such conditions and limitations as may be specified in such law.\u2019One member argued that this amendment went \u2018against the very grain\u2019 of the Objectives Resolution and the fundamental rights since it did not provide a right to appeal for convicted persons not sentenced to death. He was particularly against the proviso to clause (c) since it imposed more restrictions on criminal appeals than civil.A member of the Drafting Committee questioned the necessity of the Draft Article, since it appeared that the Supreme Court already had the power to hear a criminal appeal under Draft Article 112 (Article 136). Another member responded that Draft Article 112 gave the Supreme Court a discretionary power to hear an appeal, whereas the present Draft Article gave convicted persons the right to have their appeal heard by the court in certain circumstances.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee stated that the amendment took into account the main concerns expressed by the majority of the Assembly since it provided a right to appeal to persons sentenced to death, while requiring the certification of the High Court in other cases to ensure that the Supreme Court was not overburdened with cases. Moreover, if a lacunae in the law was identified in the future, Parliament had the freedom to expand the right to criminal appeals through legislation.All the proposed amendments were withdrawn or negatived, with the exception of the amendment proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.

It directed the State to separate the judiciary and executive in the public services within 3 years.The Draft Article enjoyed wide support. For the most part of colonial India, the judicial and executive wings of administration were fused \u2013 Indians felt this compromised judicial independence. Assembly members recounted that the separation of the executive and judiciary was a long-standing demand of the freedom movement. This demand was made at the very first meeting of the Congress in 1885 and thereafter in a range of Congress resolutions. One member was reluctant to support the Article. He suggested that the separation principle was important in the context of a foreign government, but was not sure of its salience in an independent India. He was concerned that the Draft Article would, in practice, give the judiciary undue power leading to judicially excess. In response, another member argued that judicial independence was far more critical with the \u2018advent of democracy and freedom\u2019.The Draft Article\u2019s three-year time limit did not go down well with the Assembly. Members felt that the Directive Principles of State policy must only mention broad principles and not go into the details of implementation like time-limits; An amendment was then moved to remove the three-year time limit.

A member wanted to remove the mention of specific writs in the provision. He felt that this would constrain judges: they would not be able to evolve new writs in the future. Another member was unhappy with clause 4 that allowed forthe suspension of the Draft Article during an emergencywhich he termed as a \u2018dangerous situation\u2019.It was clarified that the specific writs mentioned in the provision were in existence in Great Britain for a very long time, they have been tried and tested, and most lawyers, judges and jurists were familiar with them. It was further statedthat it was near to impossible to improve upon the existing writs and therefore there really was no possibility of new writs emerging.

It laid out the scope and limitations of the President\u2019s power to pass ordinances.One member proposed that clause (1) be amended to restrict the ordinance-making power to when neither House of Parliament was in session, as the existing provision was too expansive. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee countered that this would render the power useless because both Houses of Parliament was involved in the passage of legislation. Hence, it was necessary to allow the President to exercise these powers even if one House was in session, because then \u2018the framework for passing law in the ordinary process does not exist\u2019.Another member proposed that clause (1) be amended to include the proviso that no ordinance could \u2018deprive any citizen of his right to personal liberty except on conviction after trial by a competent court of law.\u2019 He justified this amendment by referring to the passage of ordinances in the British Provinces, which had subjected people to prolonged detention and deprived them of a trial. Even in emergency situationscitizens should not be denied ofbasic fundamental rights. In response, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee stated that clause (3) of the Draft Article already stipulated that ordinances would be \u2018subject to the same limitations as a law made by the legislature by the ordinary process\u2019, including the requirement to pass laws that were congruent with the Fundamental Rights. Since Draft Article 15 (Article 21) already provided this protection to citizens, this amendment was unnecessary.A member suggested an amendment which required ordinances to be placed before Parliament within four weeks from the date of promulgation. He argued that when read with Draft Article 69(Article 85), the effect of this provision was that an ordinance could potentially be in effect for up to seven-and-a-half months, which was an excessively long period of time. The imposition of a fixed time period within which an ordinance would expire was a necessary safeguard against the misuse of legislative power. While other members agreed with the reasoning behind this amendment, there was disagreement about the time period. One member proposed that the ordinance should automatically expire thirty days from the date of its promulgation. Another member proposed that the clause be amended to ensure that an ordinance was laid before both houses immediately after reassembly of Parliament, wherein it would cease to operate unless approved by either House. In response, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee contended that these amendments did not account for emergency situations in which Parliament simply could not reconvene within the stipulated time frame. He argued that this was an emergency power with a very restricted scope and that there were sufficient safeguards within the Draft Article and the other partsof the Constitution which would prevent misuse.The proposed amendments were negatived, and the Draft Article was accepted by the Assembly. It was adopted on 23rd May 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 130 Seat of Supreme Court..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 130 Seat of Supreme Court.The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time, appoint.Debate SummaryDuring the debate on Draft Article 108 (Article 129), a member argued that making Delhi the seat of the Supreme Court was improper and gave the city undue importance. In response, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed that the matter be dealt with in a separate article, and moved an amendment to insert the following provision after Draft Article 108:\u2018108-A. The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or at such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time,appoint.\u2019The insertion of Draft Article 108-A (Article 130) was debated on 27th May 1949. It stated that the Supreme Court would sit in Delhi, with the Chief Justice retaining the power to change this.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee justified the need to specify Delhi as the seat, stating that it was necessary for all courts to have a defined seat so that litigants would know where to approach the court. Moreover, since Delhi was the capital during the debates, it was the most appropriate city to be the seat of the Supreme Court; if the capital was changed in the future, the language of the Draft Article was flexible enough to change the seat of the Supreme Court without a constitutional amendment.One member moved two different amendments (here and here) to clarify the meaning of the Draft Article. He argued that the language of the clause was ambiguous, and it could be interpreted to exclude Delhi from the list of \u2018other place or places\u2019 selected by the Chief Justice. Therefore, if the Chief Justice decided to create circuit courts due to an increase in the Supreme Court\u2019s workload, he would be prevented from doing so by the language of the Draft Article. In response, a member stated that the language of the Draft Article was clear enough, and that the amendment by the member was needlessly complex.The amendment proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee was accepted by the Assembly, while other amendments were withdrawn by the proposing member.

From the debates, it was clear that the Article placed obligations on both the State and the citizen: the former to not recognise or confer a title and the later, to not accept one.The Assembly grappled with the question of implementation: what should be the consequences if a citizen accepts a title or the state recognised and conferred one?

It regulated the Annual Financial Statement, popularly known as Budget and laid down the scope of expenditure charged to the Consolidated Fund of India.A member moved an amendment that would, in addition to the President, also allow the Finance Minister to present the Annual Financial Statement. He pointed out that even though the President was the head of the Executive, the Finance Minister should be given the opportunity to present Budget \u2013 as he/she directly led the financial administration of the country. Further, he stressed on retaining \u2018complete and exclusive supremacy\u2019 of the Parliament on financial matters.Additionally, this member sought to give the House of the People primacy over the Budget. He argued that equality between both the Houses on finance matters \u2018fundamentally opposed to the basic idea of the Constitution\u2019. Once the Budget was finalised, the Council of the States could be given the copy of the Budget. This would ensure that popular representative will of the people determined the financial decisions of the nation.A member was keen to charge the salaries and allowances of the Ministers and the Members of the Parliament to the Consolidated Fund of India. He argued that clause 3 provides for salaries of a number of members of the constitutional bodies to be considered within the Consolidated Fund, Ministers and members of the Parliament must be treated in the same category.The Assembly rejected all these proposals.

It laid out special procedural provisions relating to the passage of financial bills. A member proposed that clause 3 of the Draft Article should be amended to prevent the government from spending any money in war-like operations outside the territory of India. This could be allowed only when thePresident sought authorization from the Parliament after providing his reasons in writing. He contended that this would not hinder the ability of the state to defend itself, insteadwould act as a check on the government's unfettered spending on wars. In response, it was argued this amendmentwould limit the executive's power in defending the nation's frontiers and integrity.Another member proposed the deletion of clause 3 of the Draft Article. He argued that this clause could be strictly interpreted to mean that no Bill could be moved in either house of the Parliamentunless on the recommendation of the President, as every Bill would require some government expenditure. In response, a member proposed the amendment of clause 3 to clarify that it would only apply where funds were sought from the Consolidated Fund of India.The aforementioned proposals were voted in negative.

He noted that the Constitution did not permit only theHouse of the People to authorisewithdrawals - such power vested with the Parliament.His suggestion to replace 'House of the People' with 'Parliament' waspositively received by the Drafting Committee.Another member argued that clause (2) of the Amendment required the House of the People to follow the procedures laid out in Draft Articles 93 and 94 (Articles 113 and 114).

The debate began with an Assembly member moving an amendment to replace \u2018and of the government of any state\u2019 with \u2018the Government of any State or any other authority\u2019. The member wanted the scope of the Auditor General\u2019s powers and duties to go beyond just State and Union government accounts. He argued that there were plans to set up a number of public sector corporations. While these were autonomous entities, they would receive significant public money and would be using public land and other assets. Hence, parliament should have the power to direct the Auditor-General to scrutinize the accounts of such bodies.A member responded to this amendment agreeing that parliament should have such powers but felt that the text of the article as it stood would allow for this -there was no need to explicitly mention \u2018other authority\u2019 in the Draft Article. There was another strand to the debate: a member felt that the rules that regulated the Auditor General\u2019s powers and duties \u2013 some of which were critical in ensuring the Auditor General\u2019s independence \u2013 had not been included in the Constitution. Instead, these were left for parliament to enact as laws. The chairman of the Drafting Committee agreed to the amendment that proposed to add \u2018other authority\u2019 to the Draft Article. On the question of rules, the chairman was sympathetic to the view but told the member who raised the issue to urge his fellow parliamentarians to enact the rules as laws once the Indian parliament commenced proceedings.The Constituent Assembly accepted the Draft Article with amendment (adding \u2018any other authority\u2019)", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 104 Penalty for sitting and voting before making oath or affirmation under article 99 or when not qualified or when disqualified..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 104 Penalty for sitting and voting before making oath or affirmation under article 99 or when not qualified or when disqualified.If a person sits or votes as a member of either House of Parliament before he has complied with the requirements of article 99, or when he knows that he is not qualified or that he is disqualified for membership thereof, or that he is prohibited from so doing by the provisions of any law made by Parliament, he shall be liable in respect of each day on which he so sits or votes to a penalty of five hundred rupees to be recovered as a debt due to the Union.Debate SummaryArticle 84, Draft Constitution, 1948If a person sits or votes as a member of either House of Parliament before he has complied with the requirements of article 81 of this Constitution, or when he knows that he is not qualified, or that he is disqualified for membership thereof, or that he is prohibited from so doing by the provisions of any law made by Parliament, he shall be liable in respect of each day on which he so sits or votes to a penalty of five hundred rupees to be recovered as a debt due to the Government of India.Draft Article 84 (Article 104, Constitution of India, 1950) was discussed on 19th May 1949.

linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions.The Article was debated on 8 December 1948. The main issue that the Assembly discussed was around the need for imparting primary education in one\u2019s mother tongue.One member moved an amendment to restrict the scope of this article to linguistic minorities. He argued that a secular state should not recognise minorities based on religion.Another member proposed to guarantee linguistic minorities the fundamental right to receive primary education in their language and script. He referred to the Government\u2019s 1947 resolution and noted that imparting primary education in one\u2019s mother tongue was a proved educational approach. He further invoked the Nehru Report, which provided for the fundamental right to be educated in one\u2019s mother tongue. He was concerned about the status of minority languages, even in regions which had a significant minority population.This found support from another member who favoured imparting primary education in one\u2019s mother tongue rather than in \u2018alien tongue and script\u2019.A member wanted to qualify this proposal by inserting \u201cin case of substantial number of such students being available\u201d. Since the Constitution secures freedom of movement, people from diverse linguistic backgrounds settle across India. He argued that it is imperative to ensure that primary education in the language of the mother tongue.In opposition, one member remarked that the ghost of 'Two nations' remained in the Assembly. Moreover, he noted that this proposal was economically unsound and would strain the tax-payers\u2019 money unless \u2018substantial number\u2019 of students opt to study in a particular language.The Constituent Assembly rejected the proposal.

The second and third clauses are self-explanatory. The Constituent Assembly debated Draft Article 14 on the 2nd, 3rd and 5th December 1948. Three key amendments were moved to the Article. The first proposed to replace the phrase \u2018law\u2019 with \u2018laws in force\u2019. It was reasoned that both terms had different meanings given to them by another article of the Constitution (Draft Article) and it was best to adopt the latter. The second wanted to include a new clause that protected individuals against \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019. This type of a provision on civil liberties, it was pointed out, could be found in the American and German Constitutions. The third amendment added \u2018prosecuted and\u2019 before \u2018punished\u2019. It was argued that if a government official was dealt with for act departmentally, he should not be prosecuted by the Courts as well for the same act, and vice versa.

It regulated vacation, resignation or removal of Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of the People.A member moved an amendment that would require the Speaker to submit his/her resignation to the President instead of the Deputy Speaker. He argued that in the interest of \u2018decorum\u2019 and \u2018proprieties\u2019 resignation must not be submitted to a subordinate officer. In opposition, a member noted that the President was the Executive head and he/she should not interfere with the Legislature. The arrangement in the Draft Article ensured the independence of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee clarified the principle behind the Draft Article. He said that resignation should be submitted to the appointing authority. In the case of Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the House of the People was the appointing authority, not the President. Since the House was a \u2018collective body\u2019 resignation need not be given to each member. It would be appropriate to submit it to the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker.After the Chairman\u2019s clarifications, the mover of the amendment withdrew it.

It established the Supreme Court of India and also laid out provisions relating to the appointment, impeachment, and conduct of its judges.There was heated debate surrounding the consultation requirement in clause (2). One member proposed the removal of this requirement altogether, allowing the President to be solely responsible for the appointment of the Chief Just. Other members suggested amendments to the parties involved in the consultation or confirmation procedure. For instance, one member proposed that the appointment of any person to the position of Chief Justice had to be subject to confirmation of a two-thirds majority vote of a joint session of Parliament. This received some support in the Assembly, although it was countered that this would result in the Chief Justice being selected at the pleasure of the leader of the majority party. Another member proposed that the Council of States also be consulted by the President for the appointment of the Chief Justice. However, this was dismissed as importing the system of electing judges, rather than selecting them, given the political nature of the Council of States. A third member, citing a memo circulated by the Federal Court and Chief Justices of various High Courts, proposed that the appointment of the Chief of Justice of India should occur only with the concurrence of the sitting Chief Justice. His amendment was positively received by some members, one of whom supported its adoption, while the other further proposed that this requirement extends to the appointment of any judge in the High Court or Supreme Court. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that the Draft Article sufficiently ensured the independence of the judiciary, as neither the executive nor the legislature had absolute authority in the matter.Other members objected to the age of retirement prescribed by the Draft Article. One member proposed that the retirement age be raised to sixty-eight years, citing the recommendations of the Federal Court on the matter. Another proposed that judges could \u2018hold their office during good behaviour or until he resigns\u2019. A third member who had qualms about the ability of older judges to keep up with the strenuous schedule imposed on members of the judiciarysuggested that the age limit be reduced to sixty years. The President could then use his discretion to extend this to sixty-five years on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the fitness and ability of the individual judge. In response, a member suggested that the matter be left to Parliament, rather than constitutionally prescribing an arbitrary age limit, while another stated that although fixing a fair age limit was a difficult task, the existing limit was\u2018by no means unfair, for it does not go beyond any reasonable age-limit\u2019.Another source of contention in the Assembly was clause (7). One member proposed that judges should be debarred from holding any executive office after retirement, while another suggested that they be debarred from holding any office of profit. While a few other members agreed with these amendments, others contended that it was unfair to limit the activities of judges post-retirement. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee agreed with the latter view, especially in situations where only a retired judge would possess the experience and capability necessary to perform public service.An important amendment was moved by a member who sought to expand the list of persons who could be appointed to the courts. Citing the example of the International Court of Justice at the Hague, he proposed that clause (3) be amended to permit the President to appoint a \u2018distinguished jurist\u2019 to the courts. This was positively received by other members and the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.A number of amendments were negatived, while others were withdrawn. All of the amendments proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee were accepted by the Assembly. Two other amendments, to clause (2) and (3) respectively, were also accepted.

1948'38-A. The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall in particular take steps for preserving and improving the breeds of cattle and prohibit the slaughter of cow and other useful cattle, specially milch and draught cattle and their young stock'.Draft Article 38-A was not part of the Draft Constitution 1948 \u2013 an Assembly member introduced it on 24 November 1948. Itdirected the State to develop the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors of the economy and to ensure that certain types of cattle were not slaughtered. TheAssembly was polarisedon religious lines: most Hindu members supported the provision and most Muslim members were reluctant. Two types of argumentswere mobilised to support the Draft Article: religious and economic. Members stated that the cow, and cattle in general, held a special status in Hindu religion and culture. The slaughter of these animals was akin to attacking the Hindu religion. Further, they argued that cattle played a key role in the Indian economy as it was the source of economically valuable goods like manure and milk. The Draft Article directed the prohibition of the slaughter of \u2018useful\u2019 cattle. Some members argued that even non-useful cattle should be protected and rejected the distinction between \u2018useful\u2019 and \u2018non-useful\u2019 cattle. Muslim memberswere suspicious of the economic rationales that were put forward in support of the Draft Article; They accused members of hidingthe true rationale which was to protect Hindu religious sentiment. Further, one Muslim member pointed out there was a large population of dead-weight cattle that was a drain on the economy. He implied that the economically reasonable thing to do with these cattle would be to slaughter them. At the end of the debate, the Draft Article was adopted by the Assembly. Many members of the Assembly had previously wanted a cow slaughter type article to be included in the legally enforceable fundamental rights section. The Assembly's decision to adopt the Article but place it in the legally unenforceable Directive Principles seems to have been a compromise.The Draft Article came up for discussion again on 14th November 1948.

However, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to restrict this to specific fundamental rights under Articles 16 (3), 32 (3), 33 and 34. One member was concerned by this move: he argued that the amendment would dilute the legislative powers of the Parliament. In response, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that through his amendment \u201conly in specific matters that Parliament has been given this penal authority\u2019. His amendment merely reiterates the specific legislative power under Articles 16 (3), 32 (3), 33 and 34.The amendments moved by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee were accepted.

It laid out the conditions of service for a Governor.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved that clause (1) be amended to prevent a member of \u2018either House of Parliament or of a House\u2019 of any State Legislature from being appointed as a Governor.The Chairman also proposed the amendment of clause (2) to read \u2018The Governor shall not hold any other office of profit\u2019.Another member of the House proposed that the requirement for the Governor to have an official residence be deleted. He argued that it was unnecessary to mention such a minor detail in the Constitution, and that other Constitutions did not include similar provisions. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that this was analogous to Draft Article 48 (Article 59) which set out the official residence of the President.There was very little debate on these proposed amendments. All amendments proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee were accepted by the Assembly, while the amendment relating to official residence was negatived. The amended Draft Article was initially adopted on 31st May 1949.Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee proposed to amend clause (3) to explicitly entitle a Governor to rent-free use of his official residence. He contended that this was necessary in light of a similar amendment to Draft Article 48 relating to the President\u2019s official residence.The same member also proposed that the Draft Article be amended to permit Parliament to determine the emoluments and allowances payable to a Governor, rather than the concerned State Legislature. He argued that this was necessary since a Governor would be appointed by the President, and therefore it was improper for a State Legislature to deliberate on the matter.Both amendments were accepted without much opposition on 14th October 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 226 Power of High Courts to issue certain writs..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 226 Power of High Courts to issue certain writs.(1) Notwithstanding anything in article 32, every High Court shall have power, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any Government, within those territories directions,orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose.(2) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any Government, authority or person may also be exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the residence of such person is not within those territories.(3) Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner, is made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1), without \u2014(a) furnishing to such party copies of such petition and all documents in support of the plea for such interim order;

Another member argued that the state legislatures should be included in the electoral college. He noted that the manner of elections of the President and Vice-President must be similar and the state legislatures must not be \u2018deprived\u2019 of electing the Vice-President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee defended the electoral composition. He pointed out that the composition of an electoral college for elections of the President and Vice-President was closely linked to their functions. The President was the head of the state whose powers extended to the centre and the states. Hence it was imperative to include state legislatures. However, the Vice-President\u2019s role was largely restricted to the centre. It did not necessitate the state legislatures\u2019 representation.There was a proposal to delete \u2018the system of proportional representation\u2019 from clause 1. The mover of the amendment argued that proportional representation, as a form of election, cannot be implemented to fill up one seat. It \u2018applies to a plurality of seats\u2019. In support of this motion, another member invoked the English example. He highlighted a Royal Commission\u2019s finding that explored all electoral systems. It found that in case of election to a single post, to secure majority \u2018vote transferability\u2019 should be employed. This system was termed as \u2018alternative vote\u2019. This should not be conflated with \u2018proportional representation\u2019. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee replied that he would consider this suggestion at a later state.Another member was keen on listing disqualifications of the Vice-President. His motion included the following grounds: \u2018conviction for treason, or any offence against the safety, security or integrity of the State, or any violation of the Constitution, or has been elected and served more than once as President or Vice- President of the Union\u2019. In response, a member pointed out that Draft Article 83 (Article 102, Constitution of India, 1950) laid down disqualifications of the members of the Parliament. Since, the Vice-President had to be qualified to be a member of the Parliament, insertion of additional grounds was unnecessary.The Assembly adopted the Article on 29th December 1948 with minor amendments that were moved by the Drafting Committee. It was further amended on 13th October 1949.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 54 Election of President..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 54 Election of President.The President shall be elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of\u2014(a) the elected members of both Houses of Parliament; and(b) the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States.Explanation.\u2014In this article and in article 55, ''State'' includes the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union territory of PondicherryDebate SummaryArticle 43, Draft Constitution of India, 1948The President shall be elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of-(a) The members of both Houses of Parliament, and(b) The elected members of the Legislatures of the States.The Constituent Assembly debated Draft Article 43 (Article 54, Constitution of India, 1950) on 10th and 13th December 1948. The Draft Article provided for the President to be elected by an electoral college consisting of members of both houses of parliament and elected members of state legislatures.The core debate on Draft Article 43 revolved around an amendmentto basepresidential elections on adult franchise; The member who moved the amendment opposed the Draft Article for not sufficiently representing the will of the people. In defence of his proposal, he argued that direct elections were indispensable to ensure that the President was the true representative of the collective sovereignty of people. He argued that his amendment took care to not make the Presidenta \u2018creature of party majorities\u2019 and would insulate the Presidentfrom the 'vicissitudes of parliamentary fortune'.There was strong opposition to this proposal. One member noted that \u2018adult citizens\u2019 would even allow Indian citizens who were otherwisedisqualified from voting in general elections to participate in presidential elections. Further, it would be inconsistent with the parliamentary form of government which \u2018presupposes responsible government\u2019. The elected representatives are entrusted with the government, not citizens themselves. Another memberargued that direct elections would make the President a \u2018party man\u2019: He/She would be supported by a political party as direct elections would necessitate active campaigning for votes. Itwas further pointedoutthat the President was not the \u2018real sovereign\u2019: he was analogous to the King of England.The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded to theproposal and highlighted its practical difficulties. First, he noted that the size of the electorate was too large and would make it extremely difficult to conduct adult franchise based presidential elections. Second, direct elections would pose several administrative issues including inadequate unofficial polling staff, bribery, corruption and election manipulation. Third, since the President in the Indian Constitution was \u2018only a figurehead\u2019, it does not necessitate elections based on adult franchise.The Assembly rejected theproposal and adopted the Draft Article with minor amendments.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Article 229 Officers and servants and the expenses of High Courts..txt", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Article 229 Officers and servants and the expenses of High Courts.(1) Appointments of officers and servants of a High Court shall be made by the Chief Justice of the Court or such other Judge or officer of the Court as he may direct: Provided that the Governor of the State may by rule require that in such cases as may be specified in the rule no person not already attached to the Court shall be appointed to any office connected with the Court save after consultation with the State Public Service Commission.(2) Subject to the provisions of any law made by the Legislature of the State, the conditions of service ofofficers and servants of a High Court shall be such as may be prescribed by rules made by the Chief Justice of the Court or by some other Judge or officer of the Court authorised by the Chief Justice to make rules for the purpose: Provided that the rules made under this clause shall, so far as they relate to salaries, allowances, leave or pensions, require the approval of the Governor of the State.(3) The administrative expenses of a High Court, including all salaries, allowances and pensions payable to or in respect of the officers and servants of the Court, shall be charged upon the Consolidated Fund of the State, and any fees or other moneys taken by the Court shall form part of that Fund.", "qas": []}]}]}
